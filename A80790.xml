         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>manifold ſeeds of Schiſmes be ſowne, and prophane Doctrines of errors be commonly vented abroad in that City</hi> (yea, in that Nation) <hi>which by ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, ſacred and ſevere an oath hath bound it ſelfe before God to caſt out all errors, hereſies and ſchiſms from the houſe of God.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:111827:3"/> The conſideration of the growth and ſpreading of ſuch pernicious errors, moved me in the courſe of my Miniſtery to ſpend ſome time in handling the <hi>firſt principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> (as they are called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12.) the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and fundamentall points of Religion, according to the method and order of the Creed, called the Apoſtles Creed, wherein they are comprized. This I conceived very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and needfull, as a chief means, if not to recover thoſe that are infected, yet to preſerve others from infection: For (as one well obſerves) a principall way of fortifying our<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> Serm. on the day of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the growth of errors, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, &amp;c. pag. 57.</note> ſelves againſt the allurements and aſſaults of falſe Teachers, is <hi>to be grounded in the principles, of the Doctrines of Chriſt, or elſe we ſhall eaſily be tumbled up and downe like looſe ſtones that lie not faſt in the building upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi> The Apoſtle himſelf doth ſhew, that ſuch as are <hi>children</hi> (to wit, <hi>in underſtanding,</hi> either altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Doctrine of Faith, or not well grounded in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20.) are ready to be <hi>toſſed to and fro, and carried away with every wind of Doctrine, by the ſleight of men and cunning craftineſſe, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</hi> Epheſ. 4. 14. And that ſuch are ſoon <hi>led captive,</hi> who are <hi>ever learning, but never able to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth,</hi> to wit, a thorough and well-grounded knowledge of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6, 7. This knowledge is (as wofull experience ſhewes) much wanting in many: And hence it is, that errors and hereſies have ſo prevailed amongſt us, whileſt ſome through ignorance are circumvented, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and drawne away, and others (though perhaps full of invectives againſt Sects, yet) have nothing to alledge in defence of truth, or onely that which is to little purpoſe, cuſtome, example, and the like; whereby it comes to paſſe, that the Authors and abettors of error do the more tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and ſuch as are inſnared by them, are the moſt faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened unto them.</p>
            <p>I grant indeed, that it is not Chriſt in the head, but Chriſt in the heart; not a bare notionall knowledge of Chriſt, but a ſpirituall knowledge of him, that will ſerve the turne. But yet nevertheleſſe Chriſt muſt be in the head, or els he cannot be in the heart; (I ſpeak in reſpect of ſuch as are of years) there muſt be a notionall knowledge of Chriſt, or elſe there cannot be a ſpirituall knowledge of
<pb facs="tcp:111827:3"/> him: As the Athenians were far wrong, who thought to worſhip an <hi>unknowne God,</hi> Acts 17. 23. ſo are they, who think to believe in an unknown Chriſt; <hi>That ye may know and believe,</hi> ſaid he, Joh. 10. 38. firſt know, and then believe. It's true, (as <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith) <hi>not the quickneſſe of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but the ſimplicity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving doth make many ſafe:</hi> Yet<note place="margin">Caeteram. turbam non intelligendi vivacitas, ſed credendi ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas tutos facit. <hi>Aug. contra Epiſt.

               </note> that of <hi>Hierome</hi> is no leſſe true, <hi>What ſimplicity, I praey you, is this, to believe you know not what? Belfarmine</hi> himſelf though in the heat of contention, and carried away with a ſpirit of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſticks not to ſay, that <hi>Faith</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>is better defined by ignorance then by knowledge:</hi> yet afterwards being in a more calme temper, he confeſſeth, that <hi>an apprehenſive knowledge is pre-required unto faith, though it be not faith it ſelf.</hi> Therefore not to ſpeak now of the impiety of the Church of Rome, that ſeeks by all means that may be, to nuzzle people in ignorance, dealing with them as the Philiſtines dealt with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who firſt put out<note place="margin">Judg. 16.</note> his eyes and made him blind, and then made a ſlave of him, and abuſed him at their pleaſure: Not to ſpeak, I ſay, of this; others there be, who are worthy to be abhorred of all Chriſtians, in that they ſo flie unto the Myſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as that they quite aboliſh and annull the Hiſtory of it; they turne all that the Scripture doth record of Chriſt into a meer Allegory. And ſome again, though perhaps they be Orthodox, and deliver nothing but what is ſound and true, yet are faulty in this, that they think it a ſufficient, yea a more then ordinary preaching of Chriſt, to have his Name fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in their mouthes, and in a generall way to ſpeake much of him, when as yet they never ſhew what he is, or what he hath done and ſuffered, nor ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver handle any one Article of FAITH concerning Chriſt, as if this were too triviall for them to trouble themſelves about, ſo that many poor ſouls, though they hear
<pb facs="tcp:111827:4"/> Chriſt mentioned a thouſand times, yet ſtill remain as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of him, and ſo as apt to entertain any falſe opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, as ever they were. For the inſtructing of ſuch, as alſo for the confirming and further edifying of thoſe, who have more knowledge, theſe Sermons here preſented to publike view, may (thorough Gods bleſſing) be uſefull and profitable. This is that, which I aimed at in the preaching, neither have I any other deſign in the publiſhing of them. I know, theſe times afford but ſmall incouragement to the Writers, and publiſhers of books of this nature. For though we may ſeem to croſſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>What have the Muſes to do</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In this Chapter, out of which the Text is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, we have a large <hi>Encomium,</hi> or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, and a clear demonſtration both of the neceſſity, and of the efficacy of it: that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done without it, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> v. 6. that nothing but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111827:5"/> may be done by it; this is proved by a cloud of witneſſes throughout the Chapter.</p>
            <p>Faith is taken two wayes: 1. There is <hi>fides quae creditur,</hi> faith which we believe, the object and matter of Faith; thus is faith to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>Jude v. 3. That you ſhould earneſtly contend for the Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints. 2. Fides quâ creditur,</hi> Faith whereby we believe, the grace of faith inherent in the ſoule, the act whereof is to believe; thus is the word taken, <hi>Rom. 1. 17. The juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> and <hi>Jam. 1. 6. Let him ask in Faith;</hi> and ſo in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places this is the proper acception of the word, though the other acception be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall.</p>
            <p>The object of Faith is God, and whatſoever is revealed by God; <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but things revealed unto us, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 29. 29. The firſt thing concerning. God to be believed, is as the Text doth tell us, that God is, <hi>He that cometh unto God, muſt believe that God is;</hi> it followes, <hi>and that he is a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him:</hi> this muſt alſo be believed, but the other firſt, and then this; firſt that God is, and then that he is a rewarder of thoſe that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now by Gods help inſiſt upon this firſt principle of Religion, that God is, or that there<note place="margin">That there is a God.</note> is a God.</p>
            <p>Let none think that this is a ſuperfluous and needleſſe labour, to go about to demonſtrate a thing ſo plain and evident as this is.</p>
            <p>For, 1. If this be a truth neceſſary for all to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111827:5"/> know and believe, then it is not unneceſſary to inſiſt upon it, and to confirm it, that we may ſee we have juſt reaſon to believe as we do.</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture tells us of ſuch <hi>fools as ſay in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 1.</note> 
               <hi>their heart, there is no God:</hi> And we read of ſome, though but few, who have denyed it not onely in their hearts, but with their mouths alſo.</p>
            <p>3. This is a corrupt age into which we are fallen, moſt of the fundamentall truths are either denied, or doubted of; and though I doe not read or hear of any, that yet ſeeks to ſhake this <hi>baſis</hi> of Religion, yet ſeeing (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>evill men and ſeducers will wax worſe and worſe,</hi> it<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 13.</note> is good to be fore-armed, and to prevent the worſt.</p>
            <p>4. This being the main foundation of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it muſt be laid ſure, that ſo the ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may be the more firm.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I come to the proof of the point, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a God.</p>
            <p>And 1. We have in this the generall conſent even of the Heathens, although <hi>Diagoras</hi> (they ſay) denied it, and <hi>Protagoras</hi> doubted of it, yet generally the Heathens did acknowledge it: yea, it's ſaid, that <hi>Protagoras</hi> was baniſhed by his Countrey-men the Athenians, becauſe he preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to queſtion ſuch a truth as this. <hi>Tullie</hi> a<note place="margin">Tul. de Nat. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. lib. 2.</note> Heathen man ſaith, <hi>Nulla gens tam effera ac bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara, quae non cognoſcit eſſe Deum. There is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo rude and barbarous, but it knowes that there is a God:</hi> It's obſerved, that even ſuch as are <hi>ſine Rege, ſine Lege,</hi> without Magiſtrates, and without Lawes, yet are not <hi>ſine Religione,</hi> altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111827:6"/> Religion. Idolaters that worſhip a falſe God, ſhew that they believe there is a God; they are ignorant indeed of the onely true God, and therefore they worſhip a falſe God inſtead of him, yet this they aſſure themſelves of, that there is a God, or elſe they would worſhip none at all: So that (as <hi>Calvin</hi> well obſerves) even Idolatry it ſelfe is <hi>hujus conceptionis amplum documentum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſt. l 1. c. 3.</note> an ample token and teſtimony of this conception, that there is a God.</p>
            <p>2. There are many wayes, whereby the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, having only the light of nature, did yet<note place="margin">Tul. de Nat. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.</note> ſee this, that there is a God. <hi>Tullie</hi> mentioneth four wayes, by which they came to be convinced of this, and (which is obſervable) I find all thoſe mentioned in Scripture as ſo many evictions of a Deity. 1. The fore-knowledge of things to come, <hi>viz.</hi> things that have no neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon ſecondary cauſes, but in that reſpect are altogether contingent, though the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Heathens were generally ſuch as did not argue a divine power, yet the argument in it ſelfe is good, and ſufficient to convince an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt: It is certain, that things in reſpect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour cauſes meerly contingent, have been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed long before they came to paſſe. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> prophecied of <hi>Cyrus</hi> by name, though he died long before <hi>Cyrus</hi> was borne; ſo<note place="margin">Eſa. 44. 28. &amp; 45. 1. 1 King. 13 2.</note> did another Prophet in like manner of <hi>Joſiah.</hi> Now this knowledge of things to come is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto God, neither can any have it, but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by God. By this argument God proves himſelfe to be the true God, and the gods of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111827:6"/> Heathens to be Idolls, vanity, and nothing. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your cauſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>bring forth your ſtrong reaſons, ſaith the King of</hi> Jacob. <hi>Let them bring forth, and ſhew us what ſhall happen; let them ſhew the former things what they be, that we may conſider them, and know the latter end of them, or declare us things to come: ſhew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods,</hi> Iſa. 41. 21, 22, 23. And again, <hi>Iſa. 43. 9. Let all the Nations be gathered together, and let the people be aſſembled: who among them can declare this, and ſhew us former things? viz.</hi> before they happen, as God ſhewed them by his Prophets, as <hi>Kimchi</hi> a Jewiſh Rabbin upon the place doth<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Kimchi ad loc.</note> well expound it. Men and Devils may gheſſe at things to come, but not certainly and infallibly know them: The Chaldeans were famous for Aſtrologie and divination, yet the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> derides them, and thoſe that gave credit to them; <hi>Stand now</hi> (ſaith he to Babylon) <hi>with thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, and with the multitude of thy Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherein thou haſt laboured from thy youth, if ſo be thou ſhalt be able to profit, if ſo be thou mayeſt prevaile: Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counſells, let now the Aſtrologers, the ſtar-gazers, the monethly Prognosticators ſtand up and ſave thee from theſe things that ſhall come upon thee: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they ſhall be as ſtubble, the fire ſhall burn them, they ſhall not deliver themſelves from the power of the flame,</hi> Iſa. 47. 12, 13, 14. and v. 11. it's ſaid, that evill ſhould come ſuddenly upon Babylon, that ſhe ſhould not know of before it came upon her; ſo that her Diviners could not only not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111827:7"/> her, and their own deſtruction, but not ſo much as fore-ſee it.</p>
            <p>2. The great benefits which accrue unto men by the temperature of the ſeaſons, and the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the earth, and the abundance of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commodities; and the Scripture ſhewes this alſo to be a good argument to prove that there is a God: The Apoſtle ſaith, that when God did not vouchſafe his Word unto men, <hi>yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he left not himſelf without witneſſe, in that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he did good, giving us rain from heaven, and fruitfull ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſſe,</hi> Acts 14. 17.</p>
            <p>3. Thunder, peſtilence, earthquake, and ſuch like terrifying and deſtroying accidents; ſo the Scripture alſo notes this as one means whereby God doth make himſelfe known, <hi>The God of glory thundereth,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 29. 3. and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times in that Pſalme he calleth thunder Gods voice, by it God ſpeaks unto men, and proclaimes unto them that there is a God. It's ſaid of <hi>Caligula</hi> the Romane Emperour, that though he were otherwiſe moſt monſtrous, and would needs make himſelf a God, yet he were ſo affrighted with thunder, that he would run under a bed to hide himſelf; this voice of the Lord did make him know, that there is one who is not a meer titular God, or a God only by uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and preſumption, but a God indeed: So all the fearfull judgements that are in the world demonſtrate that there is a God. <hi>The Lord is knowne by the judgement that he executeth,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 16.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:111827:7"/>
            <p>4. The conſtant and uniform motion of the celeſtiall bodies, the variety, beauty, and order of theſe and other things in the world. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tullie) thou ſhouldſt come into a ſtately and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tul. ubi ſupra.</note> 
               <hi>Palace, curiouſly compoſed, exquiſitly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and richly furniſhed and ſhouldſt ſee nothing in it but cats or weazells, or the like, thou wouldst never imagine that it was framed and faſhioned by thoſe creatures, but wouldst aſſure thy ſelf that there was ſome man, by whom it was built and put into that form that it is in:</hi> So all muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there is a God, who made this great and glorious houſe the world, man could never do it. No, (as one ſaith) man could never raiſe ſuch a roof as heaven, nor lay ſuch a floore as earth. Thus alſo <hi>David</hi> tells us, that <hi>the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handie worke,</hi> Pſal. 19. 1. and <hi>Paul, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of God from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1. 20.</p>
            <p>To theſe arguments I will adde but one more, and that is drawn from mans conſcience: There is a conſcience in man, which upon occaſion will accuſe, or excuſe; <hi>Their conſcience alſo bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and their thoughts in the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one anonher,</hi> Rom. 2. 15. though no man els be able to accuſe a man, yet conſcience will do it. A notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this purpoſe is that of <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, whoſe conſciences a long time after accuſed them of ſelling their brother, when none beſides
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111827:8"/> themſelves and <hi>Joſeph</hi> (whom they then little imagined to be within hearing) knew of it, <hi>Gen. 42. 21, 22. Seneca</hi> therefore ſaith excellently, <hi>Quid refert neminem ſcire, cùm tu ſeias? What matter is it, though no man elſe know what thou haſt done, when as thou thy ſelf dost know it?</hi> So on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, though all the world bear witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et if his conſcience be cleare, it will teſtifie for him, and this is enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him: <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> is our rejoycing, even the testimony of our conſcience,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. and ſo the Heathens could ſay, that a good conſcience<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hic murus aheneus esio, Nil con ſcire ſibi.</hi> Juven.</note> is <hi>murus aheneus,</hi> a wall of braſſe, a moſt ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt all calumny, and all oppoſition. Now this conſcience is the <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Soloman</hi> calls it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 27. it ſhewes plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that there is a God, from whom nothing is hid, and by whom all ſhall be rewarded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But it may be objected, if there be a God who made the world and governs the world,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: God therefore ſuffers evill, becauſe he knowes how to bring good out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: A skilfull Phyſitian can ſo temper poyſon, as to make a Soveraigne medicine of it; and ſo God can cauſe ſin it ſelf to be ſubſervient to his glory, and the good of thoſe whom he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: if there were no ſin, the glory of Gods grace in the pardoning of ſin could not appeare as it doth, <hi>Eph. 1. 6, 7.

               </note> ſaith well, <hi>It doth not belong to the ſupreme wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe of a little evill to hinder much good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the only objection that I find worth the anſwering; for that is a moſt ſilly and ſottiſh one that ſome are ſaid to make, that they ſee no God, and therefore have no reaſon to believe that there is any: By the ſame reaſon they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that there is a ſoul in man; for neither do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſee it otherwiſe then by the operations and effects of it, and thus alſo they muſt needs ſee God, who are not altogether blind and brutiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This then may let us ſee the wonderful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe of mans heart, that will rebell againſt ſo clear light, either denying, or doubting of ſo manifeſt a truth as this, that there is a God: though their conſciences convince them of this truth, yet they do what they can to ſuppreſſe and extinguiſh it, <hi>they with-hold the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. Mens actions outwardly declare what their hearts inwardly think: How did <hi>David</hi> know that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>fools ſay in their heart, that there is no God?</hi> He knew it by their wayes and doings, <hi>they are corrupt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and have done abominable things,</hi> Pſal. 14. 1. ſo Pſal. 10. 4. ſpeaking of the wicked, he ſaith, <hi>God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> or as the Marginall reading hath it, <hi>all his thoughts are there is no God.</hi> This Atheiſme is that root from whence doth proceed all ſin deliberately and wilfully committed. Did men indeed believe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111827:9"/> that there is a God, who ſees all, and will judge and recompence for all, they durſt not be ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous and abominable as they are: <hi>They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they know God,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) but in their works they deny him, being abominable and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and to every good work reprobate.</hi> This root of bitterneſſe doth naturally grow in all, even Atheiſm it ſelf, a denying that there is a God, is a part of that in-bred corruption, that we are infected with; that the regenerate are not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from an evill heart of unbeliefe even in this particular, appears both by the thoughts that ſomtimes ariſe in their hearts, and alſo by thoſe enormities that they ſometimes fall into. We are therefore to take notice of this vile and curſed nature that is in us, and to be humbled for it, and to labour that it may be changed and renewed more and more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Againe, if there be a God, we muſt be carefull to know him, and to glorifie him as God.</p>
            <p>1. To know him; for to what purpoſe is it to know that there is a God, except we alſo know what he is, ſo farre forth as he is pleaſed to make himſelf known both by his works, and by his Word? <hi>Thou Solomon my ſon, know thou the God of thy father,</hi> ſaid <hi>David, 1 Chron. 28. 9. Some have not the knowledge of God, I ſpeak this to your ſhame,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 34. And ſurely it is a great ſhame for ſuch as profeſſe themſelves Chriſtians, to be ſo ignorant of God, as many are. The Booke of Nature may afford ſome knowledge of God, but much more the Book of Scripture; <hi>In Judah is God knowne,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111827:9"/> the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 1. Why in Judah more then elſe-where? becauſe to them there <hi>were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 2. they had the Scriptures which others wanted, of whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, (not ſimply, but comparatively) that <hi>they knew not God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 5. Study both theſe books therefore, but eſpecially the later, the Scriptures, <hi>which are able to make us wiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15.</p>
            <p>But, 2. So know God, as to glorifie him alſo; <hi>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name,</hi> Pſal. 29. 2. <hi>Know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. Firſt know him, but then alſo ſerve him: The Gentiles were without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, <hi>becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,</hi> Rom. 1. 20, 21. How much more ſhall Chriſtians be without excuſe, if they doe not glorifie God as they ought, they having a farre more excellent knowledge of God, then the Gentiles had, or elſe it is a ſhame for them?

            <p>THe true knowledge of God is that which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ought to ſeek and labour for: <hi>Let not the wiſe man</hi> (the worldly wiſe man) <hi>glory in his wiſdome, nor the mighty man glory in his might: let not the rich man glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23, 24. Now the knowledge of God is:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he is; <hi>Heb. 11. 6. He that cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, muſt believe that God is.</hi> Which words I have already inſiſted on, and have handled this point, <hi>That God is,</hi> or <hi>That there is a God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What he is: For, (as I alſo before touched) it availes little to know that God is, except we alſo in ſome competent meaſure know what God is; we ſhall but be like the Heathens, of whom it's ſaid, that <hi>they were vain in their imaginations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21</note> 
               <hi>and their fooliſh heart was darkned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, the nature of God is of that infinite perfection, that it is incomprehenſible, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain to the full knowledge of it: It's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:111827:10"/> of a Philoſopher called <hi>Symonides,</hi> that<note place="margin">Cic. de Nat.

Canſt thou find out the Almighty to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi> Job 11. 7. No, it cannot be, the adequate and comprehenſive knowledge of God, to know him to the very utmoſt of his perfection, is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to God himſelf, none but God can thus know God, neither men nor Angels are capable of this knowledge: For, God is infinite, and every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is finite, and nothing that is finite can ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately and fully comprehend that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; beſides, our knowledge of God here in this life, is very weak and imperfect, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what it ſhall be hereafter in the world to come. <hi>Thou canst not ſee my face; for there ſhall no man ſee me and live,</hi> ſaid God to <hi>Moſes, Exod. 33. 20.

            </p>
            <p>The words were ſpoken by our Saviour, and that upon this occaſion, he was diſcourſing with a woman of Samaria, who by what he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid unto her, perceived him to be ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary perſon, and therefore ſhe propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a caſe of conſcience unto him, and deſired to be reſolved by him, <hi>viz.</hi> which was the right and true place of Gods worſhip; for about this the Samaritans had a controverſie with the Jewes, they worſhipping God in a certaine mountaine which they had, as their Fathers had done before them; the Jewes on the otherſide affirming that Jeruſalem was the place where men ought to worſhip: Our Saviour firſt let her know, that the Jewes were in the right, they having Gods VVord for their warrant, for that God in his VVord had appointed Jeruſalem for the time then preſent to be the place of his VVorſhip; but withall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e told her, that the hour was at hand when ſuch difference of places ſhould ceaſe, and inſtead of that ceremoniall and carnall VVorſhip that was then in uſe, there ſhould be a more pure and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Worſhip conſiſting not ſo much in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performances as before, but more in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward devotion of the heart and ſpirit: and he gives a reaſon why God requires ſuch a Worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is moſt agreeable to his nature,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111827:11"/> God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But may ſome ſay, this reaſon is of no more force for the time of the Goſpell, then for the time before: For Gods nature was the ſame before, he was then a ſpirit as much as now he is, therefore no more reaſon to worſhip God in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit now then before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, ſome more reaſon there is: for, though God were the ſame before that he is now, yet he did not ſo clearly and fully make himſelfe knowne before as now he doth: and therefore though before he did require to be worſhipped in ſpirit, (divers places there are to this purpoſe in the Old Teſtament, ſome of which I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge anon) yet now he requires it much more.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewed the coherence of the Text, I will propound the Doctrine in no other termes, then the Text it ſelf doth contain in it, <hi>viz. That</hi>

               </gap>, and ſo the Hebrew <hi>ruach,</hi> which ſignifie ſpirit, are ſomtimes uſed for breath, <hi>Ezek. 37. 5.

            <p>Againe, ſomtimes theſe Greek and Hebrew words which ſignifie ſpirit, are uſed for the wind, <hi>Joh, 3. 8. The wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> the word tranſlated wind is the ſame with this in the Text, whereas uſually elſe-where it is tranſlated ſpirit, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: and ſo the Hebrew <hi>ruach</hi> in the Old Teſtament is often thus uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> for the wind.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, the word ſpirit is after a ſort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to an incorporeall ſubſtance, when Chriſt after his Reſurrection appeared to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and they thought that they had ſeen a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Behold my hands and my feet</hi> (ſaid he unto them) <hi>that it is I my ſelfe, handle me and ſee: for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have,</hi> Luk. 24. 37, 39. and thus by ſpirit is ſometimes meant the ſoule of man, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 20. Glorifie God in your bodie, and in your ſpirit,</hi> that is, your ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. the ſoules of the godly ſeparated from their bodies, are called, <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect:</hi> ſomtimes by ſpirit is meant an Angell, the good Angells are called ſpirits, Heb. 1. 14. <hi>Are they not all ministring Spirits?</hi> and ſo the evill Angells the Devills, when the ſeventy Diſciples came unto Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Lord even the Devills are ſubject unto us through thy Name,</hi> Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Notwithſtanding in this rejoyce not, that the ſpirits are ſubject unto you: but rather rejoyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your names are written in Heaven,</hi> Luk. 10. 17. 20. thoſe whom the Diſciples called Devills, Chriſt called Spirits: And in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111827:12"/> ſpirit is meant an incorporeall ſubſtance, it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God, and he is called a Spirit; the name of ſpirit, the ſpirit, the holy ſpirit, is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the third Perſon of the Trinity, but the other Perſons are a ſpirit too, they are indeed all one and the ſame ſpirit, having all one and the ſame eſſence and nature: the divine nature of Chriſt is called the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. Being put to death in the fleſh,</hi> (that is, his humane nature) <hi>but quickned in the ſpirit,</hi> that is, by his divine nature: And our Saviour here in the Text having imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before ſpoken of the Father, the firſt Perſon of the Trinity, ſaith, <hi>God (viz.</hi> the Father, yet not excluding, but including the Son and the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>is a Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God is a ſpirit, may be further proved by theſe Arguments:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is of moſt excellency muſt needs belong unto God, <hi>O Lord, how excellent is thy Name?</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 8. 1. 9. <hi>His Name only is excellent,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 13. Now as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all things, ſubſtances, ſo amongſt all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſpirits are moſt excellent: As ſubſtances are of more excellency then accidents, ſo are ſpirits of more excellency then bodily ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the ſoul is more excellent then the body, and Angels being meer ſpirits, are more excellent then men, who are not incorporeall as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are. God therefore being moſt excellent, muſt needs be as a ſubſtance not an accident, ſo a ſpirit, not a bodily ſubſtance: Indeed God is ſo excellent that no names can be found out, whereby ſufficiently to expreſſe his nature, he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111827:13"/> infinitely tranſcends all other ſubſtances, and all other ſpirits; but yet apprehending God as we are able, we cannot but attribute the names of ſubſtance, and of ſpirit unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inviſible ſubſtances are called ſpirits: by this our Saviour proved that he was not a ſpirit,<note place="margin">Luk. 34. 29.</note> as the Diſciples ſuppoſed, becauſe he was a viſible ſubſtance. The ſoul of man being a ſpirit, is not viſible, ſo neither the Angells, as being ſpirits: They have indeed ſometimes appeared unto men, but that was only in reſpect of thoſe bodies, which for the time they aſſumed: and after this manner hath God himſelfe alſo appeared, as we find in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. and thus more eſpecially by the Incarnation God (<hi>viz.</hi> the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, the Son, one and the ſame God with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt) was made viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; by this means <hi>God was manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. <hi>The Word was made fleſh</hi> (that is, the Son of God, God the Son, was made man) <hi>and dwelt among us, and we beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:111827:13"/>3. Gods immenſity and ubiquity, his being in every place, yet ſo as not to be included in any place, proves that he is a ſpirit: For, although not every ſpirit is immenſe and every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, neither the ſouls of men, nor the Angells are ſo; yet every ſubſtance that is ſo, muſt needs be a ſpirit. For, bodily ſubſtances are neceſſarily limited and circumſcribed, they have their bounds within which they are contained, <hi>He is not here, for he is riſen,</hi> ſaid the Angell to thoſe that came to ſeek Chriſt in the ſepul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt having a true humane body, in that reſpect could not be both in the grave, and out of it at the ſame time: But God is every where at all times, <hi>Do not I the Lord fill heaven and earth?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. God is ſaid to be in heaven, as there eſpecially ſhewing forth his glory, <hi>Heaven is my Throne,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66. 1. but he is not confined there, no, <hi>the heaven, and heaven of heavens can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain thee,</hi> ſaid <hi>Solomon</hi> to God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 27. therefore God is no corporeall ſubſtance, but a ſpirit.</p>

            <p>THis place of Scripture the Jewes much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, and it is indeed a place very famous and remarkable: When one asked our Saviour which was the firſt, or chiefeſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he alledged theſe words, together with thoſe in the next Verſe, ſaying, <hi>The firſt of all the Commandements is, Hear O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Fagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> in Chald. Paraph. ad hunc lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> 
               <hi>with all thine heart, &amp;c.</hi> Mar. 12. 29. 30. But the Jewes ſuperſtitiouſly abuſe the place, writing it in parchment, and binding it to their head, and to their hands, and to the poſts of their houſes: ſo they pervert the meaning of that <hi>Deut. 6. 8, 9. And thou ſhalt bind them for a ſigne upon thine head, and they ſhall be as frontlets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thine eyes: And thou ſhalt write them upon the posts of thy houſe, and on thy gates,</hi> and ſo of thoſe parallel places <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 9. &amp; 16. ſome think
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:111827:17"/> that theſe Texts of Scripture are meerly meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall, only importing how mindfull people ſhould be of Gods precepts:<note place="margin">See <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 9. by whom it appears, that ſome among the Jewes have underſtood thoſe places in <hi>Moſes,</hi> as parallel to thoſe in <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </note> And elſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where indeed the like expreſſions are thus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically uſed, as <hi>Prov. 3. 3.

Speak unto the children of Iſrael</hi> (ſaid God to <hi>Moſes) and bid them, that they make them fringes in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: and it ſhall be unto you for a fringe, that you may looke upon it, and remember all the Commandements of the Lord, and do them, &amp;c.</hi> That the Jews were to obſerve this even according to the Letter, is without queſtion, the words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be underſtood, and it ſeems, that the other Precepts alſo were of the ſame nature, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as were to have a literall obſervation, yet withall a myſticall ſignification: For we find them joyned together as homogeneall, <hi>Mat. 23. 5. They make broad their Phylacteries, and inlarge the borders of their garments:</hi> By the Phylacteries, are meant thoſe ſentences of Scripture which the Iewes (who call them <hi>Tephillin</hi>) uſed of old, and ſtill uſe to write in parchment, and to faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111827:18"/> their heads and hands, as by the borders of their garments are meant the fringes, which they wore in thoſe borders of their garments: Our Saviour there reproves the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees<note place="margin">See <hi>Beza</hi> on Mat. 23. 4.</note> alike for both, not for having thoſe Phyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteries and thoſe borders, but for making thoſe Phylacteries broad, and inlarging thoſe borders, as deſirous to ſeem more religious, and more holy then others, ſo that the uſe of both it ſeems was required, though the abuſe were condemned, and this abuſe the Jewes were many of them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, of old, and much more are they now guilty of it, the ceremonie being out of date, and not to be uſed at all in the times of Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the words of the Text, they contain in them an Exhortation directed at firſt to the Iſraelites, but which concerns us, and all Gods people, [<hi>Hear</hi>] that is, hearken, mind, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and conſider what is ſaid, as <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,</hi> Luk. 8. 8. <hi>And, he that hath an ear, let him heare what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches,</hi> Apoc. 2. 11. <hi>Hear and give ear,</hi> Ier. 13. 15.

In this reſpect I like not that matters of controverſie ſhould be medled with, but ſo as that the principall Objections ſhould be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and anſwered; for otherwiſe the oppoſers of the truth may have great advantage, and people are apt to be ſeduced, or at leaſt, to ſtagger, when
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111827:23"/> either in books or conferences they find things objected, which before they never had any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of: This therefore I will not now diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the adverſaries of the Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Trinity, do except againſt this place, as not written by S. <hi>John,</hi> nor any part of the Scripture, and they have ſome colour for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. For, it is confeſſed, that in ſome Greek copies theſe words are not extant, nor in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack Tranſlation, which is ancient, and of good account, as likewiſe that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient writers in their Commentaries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Epiſtle, make no mention of theſe words, which argues that they did not find them in thoſe books which they peruſed. But to this I anſwer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Text for the matter contained in it, fully agrees with other places of Scripture, ſo that although this Text were not, yet the truth which it containeth may otherwiſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be proved.</p>

            <p>Firſt, they are three dictinct Perſons, differing each from other; ſo that the Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Ghoſt, neither is the Son the Holy Ghoſt; they are clearly diſtinguiſhed, <hi>Mat. 3. 16, 17. And Jeſus, when he was baptized, went up ſtraitway out of the water, and loe the heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighting upon him: And loe, a voyce from heaven, ſaying, This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Here we have the firſt Perſon, the Father, who ſpake from heaven, as is plaine by thoſe words, <hi>My beloved Son:</hi> He who hath a ſon muſt needs be a father. We have here alſo the ſecond Perſon, the Son, of whom the Father ſpake, and who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned. And ſo alſo is the third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Spirit, the holy Spirit, or Holy Ghoſt, who came down in the likeneſſe of a Dove: All theſe three are here ſo deſcribed and ſet forth, as that they plainly appeare to be diſtinct each from other. So the diſtinction of the Father and the Son, is evident from that 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9, 10. where it's ſaid, that <hi>God ſent his Son:</hi> by God there, muſt needs be meant the Father, and the Perſon ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding muſt needs be diſtinct from the Perſon ſent, ſo conſequently the Father and the Son are two dictinct Perſons: And by the ſame reaſon ſo are alſo the Father and the Holy Ghoſt; for the Father ſends, the Holy Ghoſt is ſent, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt whom the Father will ſend, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 14. 26. And ſo alſo the Son and the Holy Ghoſt are by this reaſon proved to be two diſtinct
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111827:26"/> Perſons, the Son being the Perſon ſending, and the Holy Ghoſt the Perſon ſent; <hi>I will ſend him unto you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, ſpeaking of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, that is, the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7. How theſe three Perſons are diſtinguiſhed one from another, is not ſo neceſſary to be known, as that they are diſtinguiſhed, neither may we be over-curious to inquire into it; but thus much the Scripture doth manifeſt unto us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the diſtinction of theſe divine Perſons, that the Father is from none, the Son is from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt both from the Father and the Son: This is cleare from the places already alledged, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 9, 10. Joh.</hi> 14. 26. &amp; 16. 7. And this is ſufficient to ſhew, not only that they are diſtinguiſhed, but alſo how they are diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as they are three diſtinct Perſons, ſo they are one &amp; the ſame God: This appears by that, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> except the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt were each of them God, we might not baptize, nor be baptized in their Name. For it is not lawfull to baptize, or be baptized in the Name of any but God, <hi>Were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 13. And again, v. 14, &amp; 15. <hi>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but</hi> Criſpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius, <hi>leaſt any ſhould ſay, that I had baptized in mine owne name. Paul</hi> (we ſee) abhorred this as moſt vile ſacriledge, as a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of God of his honour, that any ſhould
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:111827:26"/> be baptized in his name: So that prayer, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 24. The grace of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all;</hi> that alſo proves theſe three Perſons each one of them to be God; for prayer is to be made only unto God, <hi>Call upon me,</hi> Pſal. 50. 15. Now if they be each one of them God, then there being no more Gods then one, they muſt needs be one and the ſame God.</p>
            <p>The Godhead of the Father is confeſſed by all, the Godhead of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, I ſhall prove more fully and diſtinctly hereafter in their places; this proof may ſuffice for the preſent.</p>

               <hi>ſpoken, yea twice have I heard it</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>that power belongeth unto God.</hi> But might and power are attributed likewiſe unto men, and to Angels, <hi>The mighty men of Moab, &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 15. 15. <hi>His mighty Angels,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 7. Therefore to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh God from all others, he is called Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111827:28"/> ſo here in the Text, and likewiſe in many other places, as <hi>Gen. 28. 3. God Almighty bleſſe thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 18. <hi>ſaith the Lord Almighty,</hi> Ruth 1. 20, 21. Job 5. 17. and elſewhere he is ſtiled, <hi>the Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He and only he is Almighty: For, firſt, he and onely he can do all things. Men can do much, Angells can do more; but neither men nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels can do all things. This power belongs unto God, and to him only, <hi>He hath done whatſoever he pleaſed,</hi> Pſal. 115. 3. <hi>Is any thing too hard for the Lord?</hi> Gen. 18. 14. <hi>With God nothing is impoſſible,</hi> Luk. 1. 37. <hi>He is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we can either ask or thinke,</hi> Eph. 3. 20. <hi>He is able even to ſubdue all things unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Phil. 3. 21.</p>
            <p>2. All the power that is in all the creatures, is from God, and therefore in a more eminent manner in God. The great <hi>Behemoth,</hi> that is, (as is ſuppoſed) the Elephant, <hi>whoſe ſtrength is in his loines, and whoſe force is in the navell of his belly: Who moveth his taile like a Cedar,—Whoſe bones are as ſtrong pieces of braſſe, and like barres of iron,</hi> Job 40. 16, 17, 18. This great <hi>Behemoth</hi> (I ſay) is but one, though amongſt ſuch-like creatures, <hi>the chief one of the wayes</hi> (or works) <hi>of God. Job 40. 19. He that made him, can make his ſword to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto him.</hi> Ibid. Though he be never ſo ſtrong, yet he hath his ſtrength from God, who therefore is ſtronger, and can ſubdue him. Yea, further, all the power that all the creatures have, is Gods power, not onely as from him, but alſo as ſubſervient to him, he ordereth it and maketh
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111827:29"/> uſe of it as he pleaſeth: <hi>The Angels that excell in ſtrength, do his Commandements, hearkning to the voice of his word,</hi> Pſa. 103. 20. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> that had ſuch majeſty, and ſuch might, that all <hi>People, Nations, and Languages, trembled and feared before him; whom he would he ſlew, and whom he would he kept alive; whom he would he ſet up, and whom he would he put downe,</hi> Dan. 5. 19. even he was but Gods ſervant, as God doth call him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 9. &amp; 27. 6. God made him an inſtrument to execute his will, and to fulfill his pleaſure: <hi>They wrought for me,</hi> ſaith God, ſpeaking of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> and his Army, when they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed that rich and ſtrong City Tyrus, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29. 26. The ſtrength of Bears and of Lions God uſeth at his pleaſure, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 24. &amp; 17. 25. So the inanimate creatures which are of moſt force and might, as fire, and haile, ſnow and vapour, and ſtormy wind, they doe but fulfill his Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 8.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, God can inhibit and reſtrain the force and fury of the creatures, that they ſhall not put forth themſelves, nor act at all except he pleaſeth: He ſtopped the mouthes of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they could do nothing unto <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 6. 22. He curbed and kept in the rage of the fire, that it could have no power over the three young men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 27. Againe, God can lift up the creature above it ſelf, and make it act above its power, when he pleaſeth. He made one repaſt ſufficient for <hi>Eliah</hi> to go in the ſtrength of it forty daies, and forty nights, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 8. with five barley loaves and two ſmall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111827:29"/> fiſhes he ſatisfied many thouſands, and cauſed much to remain alſo of the fragments, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 5. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Finally, God can make the creatures work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven quite contrary to their nature: He made the waters to divide themſelves, and to ſtand on heaps, as if they had been walls of braſſe, or of marble, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 21, 22. He made the Sun to ſtand ſtill, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10. and to go back, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38. He made clay a meanes to open the eyes of him that was blind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 6. This may ſufficiently demonſtrate that God is Almighty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But there are ſome things which God cannot do, <hi>He cannot deny himſelf,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 13. <hi>He cannot lie,</hi> Tit. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Some things imply imperfection, as ſin, death, mutability, and the like: theſe things are not compatible unto God, being inconſiſtent with his perfection; the not being able to do ſuch things, doth not derogate from his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor argue any inability in him, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: For indeed he could not be Almighty, as he is,<note place="margin">Deus dicitur omnipotens facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do quod vult, non patiendo quod non vult.

               </note> if he could do (or rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer) things of that nature: <hi>God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtine) is ſaid to be Almighty, in doing what he will, not in ſuffering what he will not; for if he were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that, he were not Almighty: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe God is Almighty, there are ſome things that he cannot do, viz.</hi> ſuch things as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue imperfection: For, (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith well)

            <p>Againe, ſome things imply contradiction: as to make that which is paſt, not to be paſt; that which is, whiles it is, not to be, and the like: Theſe things alſo do not fall under the power of God, yet neither is this any diminution or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abatement of his power: God is <hi>the God of truth.</hi> Eſa. 65. 16. but both parts of a contradiction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true: If it be true, that a thing is paſt, it cannot be true that it is not paſt. <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>)<note place="margin">Quiſquis dicit, ſi Deus omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens eſt, faciat ut quae facta ſunt, facta non fuerint; non videt hoc ſe dicere, ſi Deus omnipotens eſt. faciat ut ea quae vera ſunt, eo ipſo quòd vera ſunt, falſa ſint. <hi>Aug. contra Fauſt. lib. 26. cap. 5.</hi>

               <hi>ſaith, If God be Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let him cauſe that thoſe things which are done ſhould not be done, he ſees not that he ſaith, if God be Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let him cauſe that thoſe things which are true, in that they are true, ſhould be falſe.</hi>

               </note> Concerning things of this nature, <hi>it is more meet</hi> (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> acutely obſerves) <hi>to ſay, that they cannot be done, then that God cannot do them;</hi> that is, the reaſon why God cannot do ſuch things, is in the impoſſibility of their nature, not in any defect of Gods power: Thus then God is Almighty, in that he can do all things, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111827:30"/> do not imply either contradiction or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>Now if God be Almighty, able to do whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he pleaſeth, then let us not doubt of any thing that he hath ſpoken, but though it may ſeem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtrange, yet let us be aſſured of the truth of it. <hi>Why ſhould it ſeem a thing incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe again the dead?</hi> (ſaid the Apoſtle) Act. 26. 8. So Chriſt told the Sadduces, who denied the Reſurrection of the dead, that <hi>they erred, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God,</hi> Mat. 22. 29. Whatſoever it be that God hath promiſed, let us aſſure our ſelves that it ſhall be fulfilled; let us take heed of calling into queſtion the power of God, as that noble man did, who when in a time of moſt great ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> fore-told moſt great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that to happen the very next day after, ſaid, <hi>Behold, if the Lord ſhould make windowes in heaven, might this thing be?</hi> 2 King. 7. 1, 2. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Prophet told him, that he ſhould ſee it with his eyes, but ſhould not taſt of it; and ſo (as the ſtorie ſhews) it came to paſſe, for when that plenty happened, he being appointed of the King to keep the gate, was trodden on by the people, and ſo died. So the Iſraelites in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, queſtioned whether God were able to ſupply their wants, ſaying, <hi>Can God furniſh a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the wilderneſſe?—Can he provide fleſh for his people?</hi> Pſa. 78. 19, 20. In ſpeaking thus, it's ſaid, <hi>they ſpake againſt God:</hi> It is a great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity unto God, to ſpeak or think ſo of him, as if his power were limited, as if there were any
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111827:31"/> thing above his reach, or without the ſphere of his activity, yet (which may make us take the more heed unto our ſelves) even the godly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſubject thus to diſtruſt Gods power. <hi>Sarah</hi> hearing the Lord to promiſe that ſhe ſhould bear <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſon, laughed at it, as thinking it could not be, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and ſhe being both ſo old as they were, ſhould yet have a child, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 10, 11, 12. So when God told <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would give the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe fleſh to eat, and that for a moneth together, it ſeems that <hi>Moſes</hi> did doubt of Gods ability to perform this promiſe: <hi>The people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom I am</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>are ſix hundred thouſand foot-men, and thou haſt ſaid, I will give them fleſh, that they may eat a whole moneth: Shall the flocks and the heards be ſlain for them to ſuffice them? or ſhall all the fiſh of the Sea be gathered together for them, to ſuffice them?</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> did not meerly inquire how this ſhould be done, but did even doubt how it could be done, may appeare by Gods anſwer unto him, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Is the Lords hand waxed ſhort? Thou ſhalt ſee whether my word ſhall come to paſſe unto thee, or not,</hi> Num. 11. 21, 22, 23. Thus alſo again, when the people murmuring for water, God bad <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſpeak unto the Rock, and it ſhould powre forth water: <hi>Moſes</hi> inſtead of ſpeaking to the Rock, ſmote it twice, which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, and ſpake to the people, ſaying, <hi>Heare now ye rebells, muſt we fetch you water out of this Rock?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Is this a likely thing to be done? And yet God had plainly ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:111827:31"/> him that it ſhould be done, it is evident both by his ſpeech and by his action, and moſt of all by Gods words following after, that both he and <hi>Aaron</hi> did doubt of that which God had ſaid ſhould be, <hi>Num.</hi> 20. 8, 9, 10, 11. And ſo <hi>Zacharias,</hi> the Father of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, when the Angell told him that he ſhould have a ſon, could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, becauſe he was old, and his wife alſo ſtricken in years, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 18. Theſe examples ſhew how apt the godly are to faile in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of this point, touching Gods Almighty power: But let's beware of this evill heart of unbelief; for it much provokes God, as appears by theſe very examples now alledged: How he puniſhed the noble man for his incredulity, was noted before; <hi>Sarah</hi> alſo did not paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a check, <hi>Gen. 18. 13. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were likewiſe reproved, and not onely ſo, but alſo debarred from entring into Canaan, <hi>Numb. 20. 12. 24. Deut.</hi> 32. 48, 49, 50, 51. ſo <hi>Zacharias</hi> was immediately ſtricken dumb, and was no more able to ſpeak, untill ſuch time as he ſaw the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of Gods promiſe, which he had doubted of, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 19, 20. No maryell if God be thus provoked by mans unbeliefe. For it makes Gods a liar, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10. And what greater diſhonor can be done unto God then this? On the other ſide it's ſaid, that <hi>Abraham gave glory unto God,</hi> when as <hi>againſt hope he believed in hope, &amp;c. and being not weak in faith, he conſidered not his owne body, now dead, when he was about a hundred yeers old, nor the deadneſſe of</hi> Sarahs <hi>womb,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111827:32"/> and ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbeliefe, but was ſtrong in faith, and fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to performe,</hi> Rom. 4. 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.

Hereupon the Saints and Servants of God triumph, ſaying, <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble: Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed, and

            <p>THe Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, and ſetting forth his excellency, compares him with <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was of great account with the Jews, to whom the Apoſtle wrote; <hi>Who was faithfull to him that appointed him, as alſo</hi> Moſes <hi>was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all Gods houſe,</hi> v. 2. But leaſt any ſhould conceive an equality betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Moſes,</hi> he goes on, and ſhewes the excellency of Chriſt above <hi>Moſes; For this man was counted worthy of more glory then</hi> Moſes, <hi>in as much as he who hath builded the houſe, hath more honor then the houſe,</hi> v. 3. <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a part of the houſe, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Church) but Chriſt the builder of the houſe, and ſo the Lord and Maſter of it, whenas <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he had a great place in it, yet was but a ſervant, v. 5. &amp; 6. Now having thus occaſionally mentioned houſe and building, he inſerts as by way of Parentheſis, theſe words, <hi>For every houſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:111827:34"/> is builded by ſome man, but he that built all things is God.</hi>

            <p>[<hi>All things,] Calvin</hi> liketh rather to limit this to all things belonging to the Church, the houſe of God, mentioned both before and after; yet he confeſſeth, that it may be extended to the whole Creation: This ſenſe ſeems moſt agreeable to the words, that as every houſe hath ſome man or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by whom it is built, ſo the great houſe of the world that comprehends all things in it, had God for the builder, or maker of it.</p>

Howſoever, though it be not ſo cleare when the Angels were created, yet the Scripture is expreſſe for this, that they were created, and that they alſo, as all other things, are Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: <hi>Praiſe ye him all his Angells.—Let them praiſe the Name of the Lord; for he commanded, and they were created,</hi> Pſa. 148. 2. 5. <hi>By him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities or Powers, &amp;c.</hi> Col. 1. 16.</p>

Finally, this may teach us, that meer outward and ceremoniall Worſhip is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to pleaſe God, but that the heart muſt be given unto him. God did indeed preſcribe unto the Jewes many carnall Ordinances, as they are called, <hi>Heb,</hi> 9. 10. And now alſo he doth require

For all theſe things hath my hand made, and all thoſe things have been, ſaith the Lord; but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my Word,</hi> Iſa. 66. 1, 2.</p>

            <p>OUr Saviour having cured a lame man on the Sabbath day, the Jews hearing of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to take any occaſion whereby to quarrell with him, ſought to proſecute him as a tranſgreſſor of the Law, and one that had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Sabbath, v. 16. Our Saviour ſo anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for himſelf, as to let them know that they did not rightly underſtand the Commandement concerning the Sabbath, which was not to inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and reſtrain ſuch works as did evidently make for the glory of God, and the good of men, but only ordinary works, which hinder the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe duties which God then requires. And he further ſhewes, that Gods reſting on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, after that he had made all things in ſix daies, is not ſo meant, but that God doth ſtill continually work, though not in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in thoſe firſt ſix dayes wherein he made the world, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as to make any new kinds of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:111827:41"/> yet ſo as to preſerve and govern the things that he hath made: And therefore to do any thing that is requiſite and needfull for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation either of man or beaſt, is not unlawfull. This is the meaning of theſe words; <hi>But Jeſus on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>My Father worketh hitherto,</hi>] viz. by preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and governing his creatures.</p>
            <p>[<hi>And I work,</hi>] viz. as God together with the Father, and as Man conformably to the Father.</p>
            <p>This ſufficing for the explication of the words, we may obſerve from them, That all things are <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> continually preſerved and governed of God.</p>
            <p>As God at firſt made all things, ſo he ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly preſerveth and governeth all things: That <hi>Gen. 2. 2. And he rested on the ſeventh day from all his work which he had made,</hi> is meant in reſpect of creating, not in reſpect of preſerving and governing.</p>
            <p>God then on the ſeventh day ceaſed to create any more, as he had done in the ſix dayes before; but he did not then, neither doth he yet ceaſe to preſerve and govern what he had created.</p>
            <p>That all things are preſerved of God is clear by that <hi>Act. 17. 28. In him we live and move, and have our being;</hi> not only from him as our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but in him as our preſerver. So <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 6. more expreſly it is ſaid, that God not only made all things, but alſo preſerveth them all.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:111827:43"/> to truſt not in our ſelves, nor in the creature, but in him only: Self-confidence is a thing which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the beſt are ſubject to, but a thing which God cannot indure, and in both reſpects we have the more cauſe to beware of it; <hi>I ſaid in my proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I ſhall never be moved.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> confef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of himſelf, but he preſently addes, that <hi>God did hide his face, and then he was troubled,</hi> Pſal. 30. 6, 7, For this very end God doth with-draw the light of his countenance from his children, and lay his afflicting hand upon them, that ſo they may the better know and acknowledge how they depend upon him; <hi>We had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 9.</p>

Again, what cauſe have we to feare God, and to walk humbly and obediently before him, ſeeing our dependance upon him is ſuch, as that we cannot ſubſiſt one moment without him? When <hi>Herod</hi> was incenſed againſt them of Tyre and Sidon, they were very diligent and carefull to uſe all means that might be to appeaſe him, and to reconcile themſelves unto him, and that becauſe <hi>their Countrey was nouriſhed by the Kings Countrey,</hi> Acts 12. 20. How then ſhould we take heed of provoking God! how ſhould we lay to heart his diſpleaſure! we depending upon him infinitely more then they did upon <hi>Herod: God in whoſe hand thy breath is, and whoſe are all thy wayes, haſt thou not glorified:</hi> ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,</hi> Dan. 5. 23.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:111827:43"/> we need not feare any thing, not the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that can be made againſt us, not the want of any thing that is needfull for us: <hi>We may boldly ſay, the Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me,</hi> Heb. 13. 6. <hi>Let them that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer according to the will of God,</hi> (otherwiſe they cannot ſuffer) <hi>commit the keeping of their ſouls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithfull Creator,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 19. And how little reaſon they that fear God, have to fear the want of what is good for them, <hi>David</hi> plainly ſhews, ſaying, <hi>O fear the Lord ye his Saints; for there is no want to them that fear him. The young Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger: but they that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing,</hi> Pſal. 44. 9, 10. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he alſo) <hi>the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.

            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Salvation,</hi>] There is a temporall ſalvation, that is, a deliverance and freedome from ſome temporall danger; as <hi>Exod. 14. 13. Stand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Exod. 15. 2.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:111827:46"/> freedom from eternall miſerie. Now its true of temporall ſalvation, that there is not ſalvation in any other, but in Chriſt onely. As Chriſt is God, ſo it's he and onely he that can ſave tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally; <hi>He is the God of ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 68. 20.

               <hi>of ſalvations:</hi> All manner of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever belongs unto him, as the author and worker of it.

            <p>[<hi>Nor any other Name,</hi>] That is, Perſon; as <hi>Acts 1. 15. The number of names together were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred and twenty;</hi> of names, that is, of perſons.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Vnder Heaven,</hi>] This is not referred to thoſe words, <hi>nor any other name;</hi> for no other neither under heaven, nor in heaven is given unto men, whereby to be ſaved. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but

            </p>

               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. He ever was, and ſtill is, and ever ſhall be the only Author of ſalvation; none ever were, nor are, nor ever ſhall be ſaved, but only in and through Chriſt Jeſus. This Doctrine of ſalvation by Chriſt only hath been revealed from the beginning of the world, throughout all ages, though in a different manner, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, at firſt more darkly and ſparingly, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more clearly and fully. <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for in them ye think to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, and they are they that teſtifie of me,</hi> Joh. 5. 39. By the Scriptures he means the Old Teſtament, for as then no part of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament was written. And again, in the ſame Chapter, v. 46. <hi>Had ye believed</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye would
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:111827:47"/> have believed me, for he wrote of me. Moſes</hi> was the firſt pen-man of holy Scripture, and (as Chriſt himſelf doth teſtifie) he wrote of Chriſt: And ſo we find he did, and that in his firſt Book even about the beginning of it; He records how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after man was fallen, Chriſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be his Saviour. God told the Serpent, that the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruize his head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. That is, that Chriſt <hi>made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. ſhould deſtroy the power of that <hi>old Serpent the Devill,</hi> Rev. 20. 2. So alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> relates how God promiſed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>And in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 22. 18. <hi>In thy ſeed,</hi> that is, in Chriſt, <hi>Who took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. and is called the <hi>Son of Abraham,</hi> Mat. 1. 1. And we may obſerve how Chriſt at firſt was called more generally <hi>the ſeed of the woman,</hi> but afterward more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> But further, all the Prophets did teſtifie of Chriſt, and of ſalvation thorough him only: This may be ſeen in the Prophets themſelves, if we peruſe them diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and compare their writings with the writings of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts. But becauſe this would be a long buſineſſe, and it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much time to demonſtrate this in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I will only produce two or three places of the new Teſtament, where thus much is clearly aſſerted: <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Father of <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, having ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrale, who hath viſited and redeemed his people: And hath raiſed up a horn of ſalvation for us in the houſe of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:111827:48"/> his ſervant</hi> David, (where obſerve that Chriſt is deſcribed ſtill more particularly, as being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but of <hi>David,</hi> and ſo called <hi>the ſon of David,</hi> Mat. 1. 1.) immediately he addes, <hi>As he ſpake by the mouth of his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which have been ſince the world began,</hi> Luk. 1. 68, 69, 70. So <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpeaking to the Jewes, <hi>Which of the Prophets</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>have not your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſecuted? And they have ſlaine them which have ſhewed before of the coming of the juſt One, of whom now ye have been the betrayers and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> Acts 7. 52. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo in his Sermon to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and the reſt that were with him, ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that thorow his Name whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> Acts 10. 43.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets did in words teſtifie that Chriſt is the only Saviour, ſo from the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> untill the coming of Chriſt, there were many types and figures, whereby this was ſignified: Some of theſe types and figures were extraordinary and tranſient; ſome were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and permanent. Of the former ſort was the brazen Serpent, which by Gods appointment <hi>Moſes</hi> made, and ſet upon a pole, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being ſtung with fiery Serpents, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it might be healed, as we read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. <note n="*" place="margin">This was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt lift up on the Croſſe, on whom whoſoever being ſtung by that old Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pent the Devil, looketh with the eye of faith, he ſhall be healed.</note> Our Saviour himſelf ſhewes this to have prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured him, and the benefit that cometh by him; <hi>As Moſes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lift up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe, ſo must the Son of Man be lift up: that whoſoever believeth in him, might not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 14, 15. So the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:111827:48"/> cloud which went before the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe when they journeyed, and was a guide unto them, and when they reſted abode over their heads, and kept off the ſcorching heat of the Sun from them, this cloud, I ſay, (of which ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 21, 22.) was likewiſe a type of Chriſt, by whom alone we are protected from the fire of Gods wrath, and are directed to the heavenly Canaan. The Apoſtle ſaith, that the Iſraelites <hi>were baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the cloud:</hi> It was a kind of Baptiſme unto them; it was to them as baptiſme is to us, a Sacramentall ſign pointing at Chriſt, and ſhadowing forth ſalvation by him, and him only. And ſo alſo the Sea, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſheweth in the ſame place, viz. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. the Sea thorough which the Iſraelites paſſed, when <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the Egyptians purſued them, and were ready to deſtroy them, wherein alſo their adverſaries were drowned, as the ſtory is recorded in <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. Of this nature alſo was Manna wherewith God did feed the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. The Apoſtle calls it <hi>Spirituall meat,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 3. becauſe it had a ſpirituall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſignified Chriſt, and the body of Chriſt, (even as now the bread in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper doth) that true bread which doth feed the ſoul unto eternall life, as Chriſt ſheweth at large, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. So alſo was the rock out of which God gave drink to the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Exod. 17. That Rock was Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. That is, it did repreſent and ſignifie Chriſt, like as Chriſt called the bread in the Sacrament his body, and the wine his blood,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:111827:49"/> which blood of his was alſo repreſented and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by that water out of the Rock, which therefore the Apoſtle there calls <hi>Spirituall drink,</hi> in reſpect of the ſpirituall ſignification of it. Theſe types and figures of Chriſt, I call extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and tranſient, becauſe they were only appointed upon occaſion, and to continue but for a ſhort time: But there were other types and figures of him which were of a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn inſtitution, and of a more durable nature, which therefore I call ordinary and permanent. Of this kind was the Paſſeover, or the Paſchall Lamb, the blood whereof being ſprinkled on the doors of the Iſraelites, they were preſerved when the firſt-born of the Egyptians were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. That Lamb was a figure of Chriſt, the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. by whoſe blood we are ſaved, whenas all that are not ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with it, ſhall be deſtroyed; what is ſpoken of that Lamb, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 46. is applied unto Chriſt, and alledged as meant principally of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 36. So all the ſacrifices and other rites and ceremonies of the Law had reference unto Chriſt, and did typifie him as the only Redeemer and Saviour; <hi>Which are a ſhadow of things to come,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of ſome of them) <hi>but the body is of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2. 17. <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1. 17. <hi>Grace</hi> in oppoſition to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, and <hi>truth</hi> in oppoſition to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law, which was but a ſhadow of thoſe things, the truth whereof is in Chriſt. <hi>For the Law having a ſhadow of good things to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:111827:49"/> not the very image of the things, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10. 1. <hi>For it is not poſſible that the blood of bulls and goats ſhould take away ſin,</hi> v. 4. No, it's only the blood of Chriſt which was typified by the blood of thoſe creatures, that can do it. See there what follows in the ſame Chapter: And indeed the ſcope of the whole Epiſtle is to ſhew that the ceremoniall Law did but ſhadow out Chriſt, and therefore is now aboliſhed, Chriſt being come and having accompliſhed that which it ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed.</p>
            <p>Thus in the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament is Chriſt ſet forth, as he in whom alone ſalvation is to be found. But much more clearly and fully is this revealed in the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; <hi>We uſe great plainneſſe of ſpeech: And not as</hi> Moſes, <hi>that put a vail over his face, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 3. 12, 13. The Text in hand doth plainly tell us, that <hi>there is not ſalvation in any other, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. it's ſaid that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called <hi>Jeſus, becauſe he doth ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſins.</hi> And S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us eternall life, and this life is in his Son: He that hath the Son, hath life; but he that hath not the Son, hath not life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 11, 12. Every where in the New Teſtament ſuch ſentences and ſayings are obvious.</p>
            <p>But for the fuller manifeſtation of the truth of this Doctrine, let us further conſider that all the links of the golden chain of ſalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> Election, Redemption, Adoption, Juſtification, Sanctification, and Glorification, all have reference unto Chriſt, and dependance upon him.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:111827:50"/>1. Election; God hath elected ſuch as ſhall be ſaved: <hi>God hath choſen you unto ſalvation,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 13. All they, and only they whom God hath choſen, ſhall be ſaved. Now the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, that <hi>God hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world,</hi> Eph. 1. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Redemption: All being by nature the bond-ſlaves of Satan, none can be ſaved except they be redeemed; <hi>God hath viſited and redeemed his people.</hi> And how? By Chriſt, whom he hath raiſed up to be a horn of ſalvation for us, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 68, 69. It's Chriſt who by his blood hath purchaſed eternall redemption for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Adoption: They that ſhall be ſaved are called <hi>Heirs of ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 4. 14. But <hi>if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then heirs,</hi> Rom. 8. Now by nature all are <hi>the children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. It is therefore by grace and by adoption, that any become Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and this is through Chriſt. <hi>God hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Christ unto himſelf,</hi> Eph. 1. 5. <hi>When the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Juſtification: All being naturally under the guilt of ſin, they muſt be juſtified and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from that guilt, or elſe they cannot be ſaved; to die in ſin is as much as to periſh for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 24. Now there's no being juſtified but by Chriſt, who <hi>is the Lamb of God that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſin of the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. <hi>Be it known
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:111827:50"/> unto you therefore men and brethren, that thorow this man is preached unto you forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes, Acts 13. 38, 39.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sanctification: All being by nature, as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, ſo polluted with ſin, they muſt firſt be ſanctified, before they can be ſaved: <hi>That they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them that are ſanctified,</hi> Acts 26. 18. But this ſanctification alſo is thorough Chriſt: <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 3. 5, 6. It is ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>of his fulneſſe we all receive grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 16.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Glorification: This is the higheſt ſtep of ſalvation, that which makes it compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; that which is called ſalvation <hi>ready to be revealed in the laſt time,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5. is called, <hi>the glory that ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8. 18. Now this alſo is attained through Chriſt, it's called <hi>the glory of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 14. Chriſt is himſelf already entred into this glory, and he makes way for us to enter into it: <hi>I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> ſaith he, Joh. 14. 2. <hi>Which hope we have as an anchor of the ſoul, both ſure and ſtedfast, and which entreth into that within the vaile, whither the fore-runner is for us entred, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 6. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This ſerves to confute the Papiſts, who think to find ſalvation in others, as in the Virgin
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111827:51"/> 
               <hi>Mary,</hi> and the reſt of the Saints, and ſo in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thinking (if they think as they write) to be juſtified by their own inherent righteouſneſſe, to ſatisfie the juſtice of God by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and to obtain heaven by their own merits. But we have not thus learned Chriſt: <hi>If righteouſneſſe come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 21. So in vaine did Chriſt come to be our Saviour, if we could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and merit for our ſelves, or if the Saints could ſatisfie and merit for us. <hi>All our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are as filthy rags,</hi> Eſa. 64. 4. That elect veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to be found in Chriſt, <hi>not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his own righteouſneſſe, which is of the Law, but that which is thorough the faith of Christ, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith,</hi> Phil. 3. 9.</p>

So likewiſe are they here confuted, who think that people may be ſaved by the meer light of nature, if they make a right uſe of it, and walk according to it: The meer light of nature cannot bring to the knowledge of Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom there's no ſalvation: <hi>Fleſh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he had made a worthy confeſſion of him, <hi>Mat. 16. 17. Search the Scriptures, &amp;c. for they are they that teſtifie of me,</hi> ſaith he, Joh. 5. 39. <hi>From a child thou haſt known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, thorough faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15. Whiles the Epheſians were onely under the light of nature, they were without Chriſt, and ſo having no hope, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſalvation, Eph. 2. 12.

We then here may ſee, and ſhould conſider the great goodneſſe of God towards us, in revealing Chriſt unto us: In former ages Chriſt was totally hid from the greateſt part of the world, Eph. 2. 12. That which is there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Epheſians, was (as the Text it ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there doth ſhew) the caſe and condition of all the Gentiles, that is, of all the world, except the Jewes only: And the Jews themſelves had no ſuch clear and full revelation of Chriſt, as we now have. Things were delivered unto them more obſcurely in types and figures, as before noted; But now <hi>the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation unto all men, hath appeared,</hi> or hath ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned forth, as the word in the Originall doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.<note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. Let us take heed of being ignorant of Chriſt, <hi>By his knowledge</hi> (that is, by the knowledge of him) <hi>he ſhall justifie many,</hi> Eſa. 53. 11. <hi>This is life eternall to know thee the only true God, and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 17. 3.

            <p n="2">2. Let us take heed of relying on any thing but Chriſt: Only Chriſt is a <hi>ſure foundation, in whom whoſoever believeth ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> Eſa. 28. 16. Rom. 10. 11. It is faith in Chriſt, not works, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt apprehended by faith, not our own righteouſneſſe that we muſt build upon: <hi>We conclude that a man is juſtified by faith, without the deeds of the Law,</hi> Rom. 3. 28. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved thorough faith,</hi> Eph. 2. 8. Not as faith is conſidered abſolutely, but as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered relatively; not in reſpect of it ſelf, but in reſpect of Chriſt, whom it layeth hold on and receiveth: <hi>For Chriſt doth dwell in our hearts by faith,</hi> Eph. 3. 17. And <hi>He is our peace,</hi> Eph. 2. 14. and <hi>our hope,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 1. Chriſt is the medicine that doth work the cure, faith the hand that doth apply it, without which application though the medicine be never ſo Soveraign, it can do us no good. But herewithall, we muſt remember that faith without works is dead, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. The ſame faith that looks at, and layes hold on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, (which are Yea and Amen in Chriſt) hath reſpect to the precepts alſo, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7, 8, 17. And Chriſt came as to <hi>ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. ſo to <hi>call ſinners to repentance,</hi> Mat. 9. 13. He came as to ſave, ſo alſo to ſanctifie; ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.

            <p>THe ſcope of the Author of this Epiſtle, is to ſhew, that the Leviticall Prieſthood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was but a type and figure of Chriſts Prieſthood, and that all the rites and ceremonies of the Law were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Chriſt: And in this Chapter more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly is ſhewed, that Chriſt being a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> his Prieſthood was much more excellent then that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was the firſt Prieſt under the Law. In the two Verſes before the Text it's noted, that under the Law there were many Prieſts, one ſucceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, becauſe they were mortall, and ſo one failing, another muſt ſucceed in his place; but that Chriſt is the only Prieſt having no Succeſſor, nor was there need of any, becauſe though he died, (as it was requiſite he ſhould, he being both Prieſt and Sacrifice) yet he quickly roſe again, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:111827:53"/> liveth for ever. Hence he inferreth, that Chriſt is a moſt ſufficient Saviour; <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Obſerve we therefore this Doctrine, That <hi>Chriſt is a most powerful and a moſt ſufficient Saviour.</hi>

            <p>The power and ſufficiency of Chriſt to ſave,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:111827:53"/> may appeare in theſe reſpects:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is able to ſave as well one as another: He is not only able to ſave one, or two, or a few, but all, be they never ſo many: <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth,</hi> ſaith he, Eſa. 45. 22. <hi>It is a light thing</hi> ſaith God unto him, <hi>that thou ſhouldst be my ſervant to raiſe up the Tribes of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael; I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation unto the ends of the earth,</hi> Eſa. 49. 6. See alſo <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 47. where this place is cited and expounded of Chriſt: So <hi>Simeon</hi> having Chriſt (as then a young babe) in his armes, ſaid, <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace; for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation, which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people,</hi> Luk. 2. 29, 30, 31. True it is, all are not ſaved by Chriſt, but that is not through defect in Chriſt, nor through any inability in him to ſave, but through the indiſpoſedneſſe that is in others to be ſaved: The pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> had in it vertue ſufficient to cure any, yet only ſuch were cured by it, as after the moving of the water by an Angell, did firſt enter into it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. So there is ſufficient vertue in Chriſt to ſave any, yet only ſuch as believe in him, ſhall be ſaved by him. <hi>By him all that believe, are juſtified, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 13. 39. <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to them that believed on his name,</hi> Joh. 1. 11, 12. <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life,</hi> Joh. 5. 40.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is able to ſave as wel at one time as at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as well before his Incarnation, as ſince;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:111827:54"/> 
               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, &amp; to day, &amp; the ſame for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. They that were before Chriſts coming in the fleſh, did find the power and ſufficiency of Chriſt to ſave them, as well as they have been ſince his coming: <hi>We believe that thorough the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt we ſhall be ſaved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as they,</hi> ſaid <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe that were before Chriſt, <hi>Acts 15. 11. Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it, and was glad,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, Joh. 8. 56.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is able to ſave as well from one enemy, as from another: he came for that end, <hi>that we ſhould be ſaved from the hand of all our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us,</hi> Luk. 1. 71. He is able to ſave from corporall enemies; <hi>Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,</hi> (ſaid he unto <hi>Paul) but ſpeak, and hold not thy peace; for I am with thee, and no man ſhall ſet on thee, to hurt thee,</hi> Acts 18. 9, 10. And he is able to ſave from ſpirituall enemies: From ſin, <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. From the Law: <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 3. 13. From death; <hi>The laſt enemy</hi> (that ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that holdeth out to the laſt) <hi>that ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, is death, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 26. And v. 54. &amp;c. <hi>When this corruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortall ſhall have put on immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſſe the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory. O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law; but thanks be unto God, that giveth us victory thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> From the Devill: He came
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:111827:54"/> to bruiſe the head of that old Serpent, as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the beginning, <hi>Gen. 3. 15.

Again, there being ſuch power and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Chriſt to ſave, here is comfort for all ſin-ſick ſoules, for all diſtreſſed conſciences; here is incouragement for them to come unto Chriſt, and to roll themſelves upon him: He is a Phyſitian able to cure them, be their maladies never ſo great, never ſo grievous. He cured <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> a Publican, <hi>Zacheus</hi> chief of the Publicans; <hi>Paul</hi> a perſecutor; <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that was poſſeſſed with ſeven Devills, and the Thief on the Croſſe, when he was at the point of death, which he ſuffered for his lewdneſſe: Doubt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whoſoever thou art, but he can cure thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; come unto him, and ſay as the Leper did, <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> Mat. 8. 2. and aſſuredly Chriſt will ſay unto thee, as he did to that Leper, v. 3. <hi>I will, be thou clean:</hi> For, he is not leſſe willing to ſave thoſe that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, then he is able. He invites all to come, and offers his grace unto all, if they do come; <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come unto the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price,</hi> Eſa. 55. 1. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> Mat. 11. 28. Therefore whatever thou art, if thou beeſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:111827:56"/> ſenſible of ſin, if burthened with it, if <hi>thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities be gone over thine head, and be as a heavy burthen, too heavy for thee to bear,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his iniquities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 4. Come <hi>and cast thy burthen upon the Lord,</hi> as he exhorts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 22. Caſt it upon the Lord Chriſt, who is both able and alſo willing to beare it. If thou beeſt as perplexed as the ſoul ſmitten Iaylor was, who cryed out, <hi>What muſt I do that I may be ſaved?</hi> I ſay unto thee, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 16. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>So, are we troubled for want of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe grace is ſo weak, and corruption ſo ſtrong in us? let us come unto Chriſt, who is <hi>full of grace,</hi> Ioh. 1. 14. <hi>And of his fulneſſe we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace for grace:</hi> V. 16. <hi>He is made of God unto us ſanctification, 1 Cor. 1. 30. His grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for us, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 9. Though in us there be nothing but want and weakneſſe, yet in Chriſt is all fulneſſe, and all power: <hi>I can do all things thorough Christ that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. As the conies being in themſelves weak, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their ſafety by this, that <hi>they make their houſes in the rocks,</hi> Prov. 30. 26. So let us get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rock Chriſt, and then how weak ſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we be, we are ſafe; though the Devill our adverſary be a lion, a roaring lion, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeeking whom he may devoure, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. yet Chriſt is a lion as well as he, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 5. yea, a lion ſtronger then he, more potent to ſave, then he is to deſtroy; <hi>He will bruiſe Satan under our

Therefore <hi>be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 10. <hi>Ioab</hi> fled to the horns of the Altar, and yet was never the better, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. but let us flie to Chriſt the horn of ſalvation, and whatſoever the danger be that doth purſue us, it ſhall not overtake us, we ſhall either eſcape the thing it ſelf, or at leaſt the evill of it, we ſhall not be the worſe, but the better for it: <hi>All things ſhall work together for our good,</hi> Rom. 8. 28.

               <p>2. They who pretend to Chriſt, and preſume

            <p>But firſt, <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf for the thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts Divinity, and conſubſtantiality with the Father, is expreſſe and full.</p>

            <p>4. Chriſt having immediately before ſpoken of the power of his Father, brings in theſe words (as <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo notes) to prevent the objection, that his adverſaries might have made, <hi>viz.</hi> that although the power of God, whom he called his Father, were never ſo great, what was that to him? What was it to prove that he could give eternall life unto his ſheep, and that none ſhould pluck them out of his hand? as he ſpake of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, V. 28.

            <p>And further, Chriſt having confuted the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Jewes by an Argument drawne from Scripture, he goes on and fetcheth an argument from his works for the confutation of it: <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him,</hi> v. 37, &amp; 38. The Jewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did plainly perceive, that Chriſt here did confirme that which he had ſpoken before of his being one with the Father, and that his meaning was, that he is one and the ſame God with the Father; for hereupon they were ſtill more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt him, as it is ſaid, v. 39. <hi>Therefore they ſought againe to take him, but he eſcaped out of their hands:</hi> And this may ſuffice for the clearing and vindicating of the words; and ſo I may juſtly inferre from them this doctrinall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>That Chriſt is God truly and properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>

Chriſt (I ſay) is ſo called in reſpect of his divine nature; for the <hi>Word</hi> here denotes the Son, the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, as is evident by 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. Here therefore it is expreſly affirmed, that Chriſt as the Son of God, was before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, before he was Man, and that he was God. The ſame alſo is confirmed by that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that <hi>Thomas</hi> made of him, <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> Joh. 20. 28. <hi>Thomas</hi> did not mean to flatter Chriſt as the Poet did <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> calling him his<note place="margin">Namque erit ille mihi De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, &amp;c. <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </note> God, although he knew him to be but a man; no, he believed what he ſpake, and he knew what he believed: Chriſt approved him for believing as he did, only blamed him for being ſo ſlow to believe as he was, v. 29.

            <p>Again, the Godhead of Chriſt is likewiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by that, <hi>Acts 20. 28. Take heed to your ſelves, &amp;c. to feed the Church of God which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his own blood.</hi> It is Chriſt who with his blood did purchaſe the Church, yet here it is ſaid, that God did it, therefore it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that Chriſt is God, and ſo is he plainly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Rom. 9. 5. of whom</hi> (viz. the Jewes) <hi>as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning </hi>

So <hi>Heb. 1. 8. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Son he ſaith, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</hi> What can be more plain then this, that

And thus alſo 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. of Chriſt is it ſaid, <hi>This is the true God, and eternall life,</hi> immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe words is Jeſus Chriſt mentioned, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they without violent perverting of them be referred to any other.</p>
            <p>Thus are there many places of Scripture where Chriſt is expreſly termed God, the name of God, even the only true God, is given unto him: There are alſo many other arguments which the Scripture affords, whereby to prove Chriſts God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is proved by thoſe places where Chriſt is called the Son of God, his begotten, his only begotten Son: The unbelieving Iewes did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the validity of this conſequence, that if Chriſt be the Son of God, <hi>viz.</hi> properly ſo called, as begotten of God, then alſo he is God, onely they denied the antecedent, that Chriſt is thus the Son of God. <hi>They ſought to kill him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſaid, that God was his Father, making himſelf equall with God,</hi> Ioh. 5. 18. They well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Chriſt did ſo call God his Father, as to make himſelf God, even the ſame God with the Father: For otherwiſe they themſelves did call God their Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 41. And ſo Chriſt hath taught all believers to call God, ſaying, <hi>Our Father:</hi> but they knew that Chriſt did call God his Father in another ſenſe, and ſo he did. For God is our Father, and we his children onely by adoption: <hi>God hath predeſtinated us to the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 1. 5. But God is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:111827:62"/> of Chriſt, and Chriſt is the Son of God by generation. To him God ſpeaks, ſaying, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> Pſal. 2. 5. To be thus the Son of God is peculiar unto Chriſt, neither Man nor Angell is capable of this honor, <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid God at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi> Heb. 1. 5. Therefore is Chriſt in Scripture called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>only begotten Son of God,</hi> Ioh. 3. 16. 1 Ioh. 4. 9, 10. becauſe none but he is the Son of God in that manner: Indeed in ſome ſenſe believers are ſaid to be begotten of God; <hi>Of his owne will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate he us,</hi> &amp;c. Iam. 1. 18. But this is onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that renovation which God doth worke in us by his Spirit, in which reſpect we are ſaid alſo to be <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. But Chriſt is ſo begotten of God, as to have the ſame eſſence, nature, and ſubſtance with God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he that is begotten of man, is man; ſo Chriſt being proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Intelligentiae iſtud humanae ſenſus exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, ut aliquid à naturâ originis ſuae naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo diverſum ſit.—Quis, rogo, furor eſt, nativitatem unigeniti Dei ad degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem ex Deo referre naturam, cum nativitas non niſi ex proprietate naturae ſit?

This Argument drawne from hence, that Chriſt is the begotten and the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> (who lived in the time when the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

            <p n="2">2. That Chriſt is God truly and properly, and ſo one and the ſame in eſſence and ſubſtance with the Father, may appear by comparing places of the Old Teſtament and of the New together: For ſo we may ſee, that what in the Old Teſtament is ſpoken of <hi>Jehovah</hi> the LORD, the only true God, that in the New Teſtament is interpreted of Chriſt, and applied to him as meant of him. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. we read how the Iſraelites in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe murmured againſt God, and tempted him, and therefore he ſent fiery Serpents among them to deſtroy them: <hi>The people ſpake against God, &amp;c.</hi> v. 5. <hi>And the Lord ſent fiery Serpents among the people,</hi> &amp;c. S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 9. applies this to Chriſt, and ſayes, that they tempted him, and warnes Chriſtians to take heed of tempting him as they did: <hi>Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</hi> Though it be not expreſſed, <hi>as ſome of them alſo tempted him,</hi> viz. Chriſt, yet in no congruity of ſpeech or reaſon, can it be otherwiſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And therefore this doth clearly prove that Chriſt is God the LORD. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18.

Of old haſt thou (O my God,</hi> v. 24.) <hi>laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thine hands: They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt indure; yea, all of them ſhall wax old as a garment, as a veſture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Yet this Chriſt did, as the Hiſtory of the Goſpell ſheweth, and that not inſtrumentally and miniſterially, but authoritatively, and by his owne power: <hi>Young man, I ſay unto thee ariſe,</hi> Luk, 7. 14. <hi>Maid ariſe,</hi> Luk. 8. 54. <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> Ioh. 11. 43.

            <p>To redeem, and to ſave, are acts properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto God, <hi>Eſa. 49. 26. I the Lord am thy Redeemer, and thy Saviour.</hi> Yet Chriſt alſo is our Redeemer and Saviour, as the writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles every where do ſhew.</p>

Divine worſhip is given unto Chriſt, ſuch as may not be given to any but to God onely: When he was a young Infant the Wiſemen <hi>fell downe and worſhipped him,</hi> Mat. 2. 11. His Diſciples ſeeing him aſcend up into heaven, <hi>they worſhipped him,</hi> Luk. 24. 52. Of him it was ſaid, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1. 6. All theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the circumſtances of them do evince, ſpeak of religious worſhip, which is peculiar unto God, and may not be given to any meer creature: <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Mat. 4. 10. The Angell would not be worſhipped by <hi>John,</hi> but bad him give that honor to God, and worſhip him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. &amp; 22. 9. More particularly, Faith and Hope are onely to

Prayer is to be made only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; <hi>Call upon me,</hi> ſaith God, Pſal. 50. 15. yet <hi>Stephen</hi> being full of the Holy Ghoſt, gave this honour unto Chriſt, he prayed unto him, ſaying, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit,</hi> Acts 7. 55. &amp; 59. Thus both teſtimonies of Scripture, and arguments drawn from Scripture make it moſt evident, that Chriſt is God truly and properly ſo called, even one and the ſame God with the Father.</p>

            <p>He was conceived in her, and ſo in her, as that he was conceived of her, that is, of her ſubſtance. It's ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>he took upon him the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, Heb. 2. 16. And that according to the fleſh, he was raiſed up <hi>of the fruit of</hi> Davids <hi>loines,</hi> Acts 2. 30.

This is a moſt erroneous conceit, and flatly repugnant to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:111827:69"/> Scriptures before alledged; and though there be ſome places which may ſeem to favour it, yet indeed they do not; as that 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 47.

No man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came downe from heaven, &amp;c.</hi> And that <hi>Ioh: 6. 38. I came down from heaven.</hi> Theſe places do not import any ſuch thing, as that Chriſt brought a body downe with him from heaven, but onely he is ſaid to be from heaven, and to come from heaven, becauſe as God being in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (which is called Gods dwelling place, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 39. and his throne, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66. 1.) by his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being made man he was upon earth, and ſo after a ſort came down from heaven: Chriſt as man did not come down from heaven, for he was not as man in heaven untill his Aſcenſion: That Ioh. 3. 13. <hi>The Son of man which is in heaven,</hi> was ſpoken of Chriſt the Son of Man, but not as the Son of Man; for ſo he was then when it was ſpoken upon earth, and not in heaven.

And the ſame Perſon being both God and Man, Chriſt denominated by his humane nature is ſaid then to have been in heaven, though this did agree to him only in reſpect of his divine nature. Chriſt therefore, I ſay, as man, did not come downe from heaven, neither properly did he come down
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:111827:70"/> from heaven as God, but only in a Metaphoricall ſenſe in that the divine nature was united to the humane nature; <hi>The Word was made fleſh</hi> (God was made man) <hi>and dwelt among us,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. otherwiſe properly the divine nature can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſcend nor deſcend, cannot remove from one place to another, becauſe it is immenſe and infinite.</p>

            <p>But I leave this point, and come to the other <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> which the Text doth hold forth unto us, <hi>viz. That</hi> Mary <hi>the wife of</hi> Joſeph <hi>was ſo the Mother of Chriſt, as that nevertheleſſe when ſhe bare him ſhe was a most pure Virgin, conceiving him not by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, but by the power of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>of the Holy Ghost,</hi> it is meant of the Holy Ghoſt not as the matter, but as the efficient, in which ſenſe it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 12. All things (are) of God.</hi> Again, though the Holy Ghoſt only be expreſſed, yet the other Perſons of the Trinity are not excluded: The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Father, ſaith, <hi>Of whom are all things, 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 6. If all things be of the Father, then Chriſts body was of him, <hi>viz.</hi> as the worker and maker of it; and as of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo alſo of the Son, who is the ſame ſubſtance with the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 30. And by whom like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all things were made, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Mary</hi> was thus the Mother of Chriſt, is evident both by the Text, and alſo by that which goes before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 18. and that which followes after, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 22, 23, 24, 25. ſo by that <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It may be objected, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is called
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:111827:73"/> Chriſts Father; <hi>Is not this</hi> Joſephs <hi>Son?</hi> ſaid ſome of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: They ſuppoſed ſo, but it was not ſo as they ſuppoſed: That this was but a ſuppoſition, S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſhewes in the fore-going Chapter, v. 23. where he ſaith that Chriſt was (<hi>as was ſuppoſed) the Son of</hi> Ioſeph, not ſo indeed, but only as was ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But may ſome ſay, <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf did call <hi>Ioſeph</hi> Chriſts Father; <hi>Thy Father and I have ſought thee ſorrowing,</hi> ſaid ſhe to Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 48.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True; but how did ſhe mean that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was his father? not his naturall father that begot him, but his legall father, as being the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his mother: <hi>Ioſeph</hi> alſo was Chriſts fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-father, or nurſing-father, he who did educate him and bring him up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may yet object, if <hi>Ioſeph</hi> were not Chriſts naturall Father, how is Chriſts Genealogie fetched from <hi>Ioſeph?</hi> how is Chriſt ſhewed to be the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> by this, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did deſcend from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 1. Luk. 3.</note> and from <hi>David?</hi> How doth this follow, except as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did proceed from them, ſo Chriſt did proceed from <hi>Ioſeph?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this it is anſwered, That <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> were both of one Tribe and of one Family, by vertue of that Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 36. 8. where it is required, that every woman being an inheritreſſe, ſhould marrie to one of her own Tribe and Family, that ſo inheritances might not paſſe from one Tribe or Family to another: And therefore the rehearſing of Chriſts Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:111827:73"/> by <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a rehearſing of it by <hi>Mary,</hi> it being ſhewed that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was of the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> the ſame was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhewed concerning <hi>Mary,</hi> who by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Law fore-mentioned was married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and ſo it followes that Chriſt alſo by that rehearſall is demonſtrated to deſcend from <hi>Abraham</hi> and from <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Some may yet object, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is called <hi>Maries</hi> Kinſwoman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 36. Now <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> was of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Levi, Luk.</hi> 1. 5. whereas <hi>David</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſo Chriſt who deſcended from <hi>David, Heb.</hi> 7. 14. How then did <hi>Mary</hi> deſcend from <hi>David,</hi> and not rather from <hi>Aaron</hi> as <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> her kinſwoman did?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It doth not follow, that becauſe <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> was of the daughters of <hi>Aaron,</hi> therefore <hi>Mary</hi> being her kinſwoman was ſo too: For though ſuch women as had no brethren, and ſo had inheritances, were to marrie in their owne Tribe and Family, yet others were not tied to this. The men of <hi>Benjamin</hi> did marrie women that were of other Tribes, as we read <hi>Iudges</hi> 21. And had it not been lawfull for them to marry in that manner, what needed that Oath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Iudg. 21. 1.? why ſhould the other Tribes ſwear (as they did) that they would not give their daughters to the Benjamites, if it were not lawfull for thoſe of one Tribe to marry with thoſe of another Tribe? So 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 11. it's ſaid, that <hi>Iehoſhabeath</hi> the daughter of King <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> was wife to <hi>Iehojada</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:111827:74"/> the Prieſt, who was of the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might be of <hi>Levi</hi> and of <hi>Aaron</hi> by the fathers ſide, and of <hi>Judah</hi> and of <hi>David</hi> by the mothers ſide, and ſo by her mother be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it was requiſite that Chriſt ſhould thus be conceived, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as that his Mother ſhould be a Virgin, becauſe it was requiſite that he ſhould be conceived without ſin; he that came to take away our ſin, was himſelf to be without ſin. <hi>For ſuch an high Prieſt became us, who is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, harmleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> Heb. 7. 26. But ſuch as are conceived after the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, are conceived in ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. The Papiſts generally of late times do except the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt, and will have her to have been conceived without ſin, to have been free from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall corruption: Thus (I ſay) they do of late times; for <hi>Bonaventure</hi> who was betwixt 300.<note place="margin">

And he alſo gives this reaſon why all ſhould hold ſo, <hi>Nè dum gloria Matris ampliatur, gloria filii minuatur, least whiles the glory of the Mother be increaſed, the glory of the Son (of Chriſt) be diminiſhed.</hi> But now as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:111827:74"/> that immaculate Conception of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> he ſaies indeed, that notwithſtanding all this, they do not hold that opinion (of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> being conceived without ſin) as certain, but only as probable: How this will conſiſt with that infallibility and authority which the Pope challengeth, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo maintaineth to belong unto him, let others judge; but, ſay I, what probability is there in that opinion which hath no warrant from Scripture? yea, 'tis againſt Scripture: The Scripture affirming, that <hi>by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ſin entred into the world, and all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. Neither doth the Scripture except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but Chriſt onely, who was conceived and born by the miraculous power and operation of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. The uſe of this point is firſt for our conſolation: For Chriſt being thus conceived, and ſo without ſin, whatſoever he ſuffered, it was not for himſelf, but for us, not for any ſin of his own, but for our ſins. And therefore, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Ioh. 1. 29. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the ends of the earth,</hi> Eſa. 45. 22.

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. But ſecondly, it ſerves alſo for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition: For as Chriſt was corporally concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Holy Ghoſt in the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſo
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:111827:75"/> muſt he alſo by the Holy Ghoſt be ſpiritually conceived in us, or elſe we ſhall have no benefit by him: we muſt conceive him in our hearts by faith working thorough love, and bringing forth the fruits of righteouſneſſe. The Apoſtle told the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that he did travell with them in birth <hi>untill Chriſt were formed in them,</hi> Gal. 4. 19.

               <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory?</hi> Luke 24. 26. Firſt, he was to ſuffer ſuch things, and then having ſuffered them, to enter into his glory: <hi>Now that he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what is it, but that he deſcended first?</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 4. 9. His deſcenſion was before his aſcenſion, <hi>He was made perfect through ſufferings,</hi> Heb. 2. 10.</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary, that if Chriſt ſhould have any eſtate of humiliation at all, it ſhould be before his eſtate of exaltation: For being once exalted and in glory, he could not poſſibly be ſubject to any ſorrow or ſuffering. The eſtate of glory is inconſiſtent with ſorrow and ſuffering; <hi>Christ being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him,</hi> Rom. 6. 9. So, had he at firſt entred into glory before his ſuffering, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, nor any affliction (which ſeems to make way for death) could have laid hold on him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may ſome ſay, why ſhould Chriſt be ſubject to any ſorrow at all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: There was reaſon for it in divers reſpects:</p>
            <p n="1">1. God ſo determined, it was his will and pleaſure it ſhould be ſo: <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:111827:77"/> bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief,</hi> Eſa. 53. 10. It was the cup that his Father gave him to drink, <hi>Joh. 18. 11. Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> with the Gentiles and the Jewes, did but what God had before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be done, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27, 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God not only determined, but alſo ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made it knowne before-hand, that ſo it ſhould be, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer; <hi>Saying none other things then</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets</hi> (that is, God by them) <hi>did ſay ſhould come, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 26. 22, 23. <hi>Thoſe things that God before had ſhewed by the mouth of his Prophets, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, he hath ſo fulfilled,</hi> Act. 3. 18. <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, &amp;c.</hi> even therefore becauſe it was ſo written, Luk. 24. 46. <hi>Thinkeſt thou</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſought to keep him from ſuffering) <hi>that I cannot now pray unto my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more then twelve Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? But how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be?</hi> Mat. 26. 53, 54.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our caſe and condition did require that ſo it ſhould be; Chriſt was to ſuffer, that ſo we might not ſuffer; I mean, not ſuffer ſo, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt have ſuffered, even ſo, as <hi>to lie down in ſorrow,</hi> ſo as to ſuffer eternall woe and miſery:<note place="margin">Eſa. 50. 11</note> God was injured and offended, and his Juſtice would be ſatisfied; we were utterly unable to make ſatisfaction without lying under everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting condemnation. Therefore that we might not periſh, it was requiſite that Chriſt ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and by ſuffering ſatisfie for us: <hi>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our ſorrowes.—He
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:111827:77"/> was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes are we healed. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, and turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all,</hi> Eſa. 53. 4, 5, 6. <hi>God made him to be ſin,</hi> an offering and a ſacrifice for ſin) <hi>for us, who knew no ſin,</hi> [that is, was guilty of none] <hi>that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> a Cor. 5. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If it were thus with the Head, then ſo alſo it muſt be with the Members; if thus with Chriſt, then ſo alſo with Chriſtians: <hi>For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predestinate to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Image of his Son, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 8. 29. God hath predeſtinated us to be conform'd unto Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt in ſorrow and ſuffering, and then in glory and happineſſe: <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. <hi>If we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 11, 12. If Chriſt the Captain of our Salvation were made perfect by ſufferings, as it is ſaid of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. then we muſt not think to be made perfect without ſufferings, but muſt look to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt, as ſouldiers do their Captain. <hi>Thou therefore endure hardneſſe as a good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 3. When ſome deſired of Chriſt, that they might ſit one at his right hand, the other at his left in his glory; Chriſt told them, that they knew not what they asked: and asked them, if they could drink of the cup that he was to drink of, and be baptized with the baptiſm that he was
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:111827:78"/> to be baptized with, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 37, 38. He gave them to underſtand, that they ſhould firſt think of partaking vvith him in his ſufferings, before they could partake vvith them in his glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Suffering is a means vvhereby Chriſt doth try vvho are his: <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. True, but God makes it appear by the croſſes and afflictions that he layes upon them; hereby their faith, patience, ſelf-deniall, ſubmiſſion unto God, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God is made manifeſt: <hi>Thou, O God, haſt proved us, thou haſt tried us as ſilver is tried,</hi> ſay the people of God unto him; And hovv did he prove and try them? They adde, <hi>Thou broughtest us into the net, thou laidſt affliction upon our loins: Thou madeſt men to ride over our heads,</hi> Pſal. 66. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Now for a ſeaſon</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſpeaking to thoſe vvho had received Chriſt into their hearts by faith) <hi>if need be, ye are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe through manifold temptations, that the triall of your faith being much more pretious then of gold that periſheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praiſe, and honour, and glory at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7. And <hi>beloved, think it not ſtrange</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>concerning the fiery tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all which is to try you, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 12. See alſo Rev. 2. 10. &amp; 3. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suffering is a means vvhereby God doth purge and refine thoſe that are his, and ſo vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth prepare and fit them for the glory that he hath prepared for them; even as the fire not onely tries the gold or ſilver, but alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it from the droſſe that vvas mixed vvith it:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:111827:78"/> 
               <hi>Some of them of underſtanding ſhall fall</hi> (into affliction) <hi>to try them, and to purge them, and to make them white,</hi> Dan. 11. 35.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Let us then be admoniſhed to think of this, that Chriſt ſuffered before he reigned, firſt he was crowned with thornes, before he was crowned with glory, and ſo it muſt accordingly fare with us, if we belong unto Chriſt: let us (I ſay) think of it, and prepare for it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are apt to put far away ſorrow and ſuffering, to put it far from our thoughts, like the ſons of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> Mar. 10. 37. who were more ready to think of reigning with Chriſt, then to think of ſuffering, though (as Chriſt taught them) that be firſt to be thought of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereupon we become unable to ſuffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſo unmindfull of ſuffering: <hi>Think not ſtrange, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 12. Becauſe we do not think of it before it cometh, therefore we think it ſtrange when it cometh: The blow that comes ſuddenly ſtrikes ſore, whereas <hi>praemonitus praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus,</hi> fore-warned, fore-armed; <hi>praeviſa jacula, minùs feriunt,</hi> the blow that is fore-ſeen, if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prevented, yet it may be received ſo as to do the leſſe hurt; <hi>Jeruſalem remembred not her last end, therefore ſhe came down wonderfully,</hi> Lam. 1. 9. And the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that he ſent <hi>Timotheus</hi> unto them, <hi>that no man ſhould be moved with thoſe afflictions,</hi> (which happened unto him, and might alſo happen unto them) <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your ſelves know that we are appointed thereunto: For verily when we were with you, we told you before, that we ſhould ſuffer tribulation, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:111827:79"/> as it came to paſſe, and ye know,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3. 3, 4. He fore-told them of it, that ſo they might not ſtartle or ſtagger at it vvhen it came to paſſe: So Chriſt having told his Diſciples, that the time was coming, vvhen as they that did kill them would think they did God ſervice, he addes, <hi>But theſe things have I told you, that when the time ſhall come, ye may remember that I told you of them,</hi> Joh. 16. 24. And Luk. 14. 28. &amp;c. Chriſt propoundeth tvvo Parables to this end, to ſhevv that if vve vvill indeed be his Diſciples vve muſt reckon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, and make account of ſuffering vvith him, and for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But may ſome object, If this be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Chriſtian, hovv then is Chriſts yoke eaſie, and his burthen light, as he affirmes it to be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I anſvver, that the yoke and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then as of ſervice, ſo of ſuffering, which Chriſt doth put upon a Chriſtian, is eaſie and light. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt having gone before, hath made way for a Chriſtian to follow after; <hi>In the world</hi> [ſaith he] <hi>ye ſhall have tribulation, but be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I have overcome the world,</hi> Joh. 16. 33.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt doth moderate the affliction, and gives ſtrength to bear it; he will not ſuffer thoſe that belong unto him to be tempted above what they are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape it, that they may be able to bear it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. His grace is ſufficient for them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Here is comfort and incouragement for
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:111827:79"/> all true Chriſtians; they need not to be dejected and diſmaied, becauſe of any ſorrow or ſuffering that doth befall them; for it fares no otherwiſe with them, then it fared with Chriſt himſelf; yea, indeed all that they can ſuffer is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what he ſuffered: Let's conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is very abſurd, and againſt all reaſon, that we ſhould think much to be under that condition that Chriſt himſelf was under: <hi>The Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant above his Lord. It is enough for the Diſciple to be as his Maſter, and the Servant as his Lord, if they have called the Maſter of the houſe Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub, how much more will they call them of his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold?</hi> Mat. 10. 24, 25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is an honour for us to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Chriſt in ſuffering as he ſuffered: <hi>If I muſt needs glory, I will glory in the things which concern mine infirmities,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 11. 30. God forbid</hi> (ſaid he alſo) <hi>that I ſhould glory ſave in the Croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world,</hi> Gal. 6. 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Chriſt having himſelf been ſo acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with grief and ſorrow, he can and will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate us in our ſufferings: <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2. 18. <hi>For we have not an High Prieſt that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points like as we are, yet without ſin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtaine mercy, and find grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:111827:80"/> 4. 15. 16. yea, Chriſt doth account the ſuffering of his members to be his own ſuffering: <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> ſaid he, when <hi>Saul</hi> did perſecute Chriſtians, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 4. &amp; v. 5. <hi>I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That if we would be conformed unto Chriſt in ſuffering, we ſhall alſo be conformed unto him in glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11. 12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Peter</hi> bids, <hi>Rejoyce, inaſmuch as ye are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſts ſufferings, that when his glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy,</hi> 1 Pet.. 4.. 13. This is the miſerie of ſuch as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens from Chriſt, that their joy ſhall be turned into ſorrow; <hi>Even in laughter the heart is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, and the end of that mirth is heavineſſe,</hi> Prov. 14. 13. <hi>As the crackling of thorns under a pot, ſo is the laughter of a fool,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 6. On the other ſide this is the happineſſe of thoſe that are Chriſts, that their ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy, as Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20. And ſee there, v. 21. &amp; 22. Let us therefore look unto the end of our ſuffering, what it tends to, and what will be the iſſue of it, and we ſhall ſee there's reaſon not to be troubled at it, but to rejoyce in it: <hi>Chriſt for the joy that was ſet before him, indured the Croſſe, despiſing the ſhame,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. And there we are bidden to look unto him, to imitate him, and ſo to run with patience the race that is ſet before us. <hi>Thus by faith</hi> Moſes, <hi>when he was come to years, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharoahs <hi>daughter, chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to injoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; esteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:111827:80"/> the treaſures in Aegypt:</hi> And why? <hi>for he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the recompence of reward,</hi> Heb. 11. 24, 25, 26. So <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth of himſelf, ſaying, <hi>We faint not, but though our outward man periſh, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is renewed day by day. For our light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternall weight of glory, whiles we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen are temporall, but the things which are not ſeen are eternall, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caution.</hi> But our care muſt be, that in reſpect of the ground and cauſe of our ſuffering, we be like unto Chriſt, that is, that we do not ſuffer for ill-doing, but for well-doing, I mean in reſpect of men; for otherwiſe if God ſhall contend with us, we cannot anſwer to one of a thouſand, <hi>Job 9. 4. Righteous art thou O Lord, and juſt are thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 137. Yet in the ſame Pſalme ſpeaking of men, v. 86. he ſaith, <hi>They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute me wrongfully.</hi> So muſt it be our care to ſuffer, when we do ſuffer by the hands of men, or elſe we are not conformed unto Chriſt in our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, we do not ſuffer as he ſuffered; for he did nothing for which to ſuffer: No, <hi>He was holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. <hi>He did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 22. <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin?</hi> ſaid he to his moſt malicious adverſaries, Joh. 8. 46. <hi>They hated me without a cauſe,</hi> ſaid he, Joh. 15. 25. <hi>This man hath done nothing amiſſe,</hi> ſaid one of him, that was crucified together with him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 41. And ſo <hi>Pilate</hi> that condemned him,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:111827:81"/> did yet often times (as the Evangeliſts record) confeſſe that he found no fault in him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Non paena, ſed cauſa facit Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrem.

               </note> if we ſuffer as Malefactors and evill doers, we do not ſuffer as Chriſt ſuffered. <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt not ſimply, they that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, but that are perſecuted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſake) <hi>for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.

But all this was but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſts ſorrows, his chief ſuffering was at laſt, at and immediately before his death, from the time of his agony in the garden, to the time of his hanging and dying upon the Croſſe. That which he then ſuffered was ſuch and ſo great; that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it is called his Paſſion, or his ſuffering. Let us therefore a little (as we are able) ſee and conſider what he then ſuffered. And he fuffered (as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:111827:82"/> the Scripture ſhews) both outwardly &amp; inwardly.</p>
            <p>He ſuffered outwardly, 1. in his reputation, for goods he had none to ſuffer in, except his clothes, which he was deveſted of, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 23. 24. But for his reputation he ſuffered much in it; and that is no ſmal ſuffering. <hi>For a good name is better then precious ointment,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 1. <hi>A good name is rather to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen then great riches,</hi> Prov. 22. 1. <hi>A good report maketh the bones fat,</hi> Prov. 15. 30. Therefore on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, an evil report, ſlaunder, and defamation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and reproach maketh the bones lean, its a great griefe, a great vexation. <hi>Falſe witneſſes did riſe up againſt me, they laid to my charge things that I knew not.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> complains of the hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that he found from ſome, Pſal. 35. 11. &amp; v. 21. <hi>Yea, they opened their mouth wide againſt me, and ſaid, Aha, Aha, our eye hath ſeen it.</hi> And Pſal. 120. 2. he cries out, <hi>Deliver my ſoul from lying lips, &amp; from a deceitfull tongue.</hi> And Pſal. 123. 3, 4. <hi>Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us,</hi> cry the people of God unto him, <hi>for we are exceedingly filled with contempt: our ſoul is exceedingly filled with the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe that are at eaſe, and with the contempt of the proud.</hi> Amongſt other grievous ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings which the Saints endured, are reckoned <hi>mockings,</hi> Heb. 11. 36. In this reſpect its ſaid that <hi>Iſmael perſecuted Iſaac,</hi> Gal. 4. 29. in that <hi>he mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him,</hi> Gen. 21. 9. Now how was Chriſt traduced and ſlandered? how viſited and reproached? how taunted and mocked? <hi>We have found this fellow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Nation</hi> (ſaid his malicious adverſaries of him) <hi>and forbidding to give tribute to Caeſar, ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing that he himſelf is Chriſt a King.</hi> Luk. 23. 2. Thus
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:111827:83"/> they accuſed him moſt falſly; for he taught the people quite contrary both by word and deed, as appears <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 17. &amp; 17. 24, 25, 26, 27. So they called him a <hi>deceiver,</hi> yea <hi>that deceiver,</hi> as if he had been the grand Impoſtor, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 63. whereas he is <hi>the Amen, the true and faithfull witneſſe,</hi> Revel. 3. 14. <hi>Yea the truth it ſelf,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. They cloathed him with a ſcarlet robe, put a crown of thorns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head, and a reed (in ſtead of a Scepter) in his hand, and bowed the knee before him, and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſaying, <hi>Hail King of the Iewes,</hi> Mat. 27. 28, 29. As he hung upon the Croſſe, <hi>they that paſſed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and ſaying, Thou that destroyest the Temple, and buildeſt it againe in three daies, ſave thy ſelf; If thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſſe, likewiſe alſo the chiefe Priests mocking him, with the Scribes and Elders, ſaid, he ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave. If he be the King of Iſrael, let him now come down from the Croſſe, and we will believe him. He truſted in God, let him deliver him now if he will have him; for he ſaid, I am the Son of God: The thieves alſo that were crucified with him, caſt the ſame in his teeth,</hi> Mat. 27. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44. They not only crucified him, which was a thing ignominious and ſhamefull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, but they crucified him betwixt two thieves, ſo that <hi>he was numbered among the tranſgreſſors,</hi> Iſai. 53. 12. Mar. 15. 28. Yea he was accounted the chief tranſgreſſor.</p>
            <p>2. He ſuffered outwardly in his body, What part of his body was free from ſuffering? his head was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:111827:83"/> he was crucified. And by theſe ſufferings, together with the toſſing of him from place to place, want of ſleep, and the like, he was ſo wearied and ſo vveakned, that he vvas not able to bear his Croſſe (it ſeems) to the place vvhere he vvas crucified. Its ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 17. that he vvent <hi>bearing his Croſſe;</hi>

But its ſaid Mat. 27. 32. <hi>As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene,</hi> Simon <hi>by name; him they compelled to bear his Croſſe.</hi> So Luk. 23. 26. It appears by comparing the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts together, that Chriſt at firſt (as the manner vvas) bore his Croſſe himſelf, but aftervvards in the vvay, they perceiving him unable to bear it, laid hold on that <hi>Simon,</hi> whom they met, and made him to bear it. After this, his hands and feet (parts<note place="margin">

All this bodily pain that Chriſt indured, is juſtly conceived to have been ſo much the more vehement and grievous, by hovv much his body vvas of a more excellent temper &amp; complexion, as being miraculouſly formed and framed by the holy Ghoſt, Luk. 1. 35. For things that are vvrought ſupernaturally by miracle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell thoſe things that are effected by naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as the vvine that Chriſt did miraculouſly make of vvater, was better then other vvine, Joh. 2. 10.</p>
            <p>Chriſt alſo ſuffered invvardly, and his invvard ſuffering vvas his ſoreſt ſuffering; the ſuffering of his body, vvas but as the body of his ſuffering; the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:111827:84"/> ſuffering of his ſoule, was as the ſoule of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. <hi>The ſpirit of a man will bear his infirmity, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18. 14.

               <hi>ſorrowfull unto death.</hi> He was invironed, compaſſed round about with ſorrow, ſo that there was no way to turn, but ſtill ſorrow was in the way; ſo much the Greek word there uſed doth import. In the cold night, lying on the cold ground, he did ſweat, and that in a moſt ſtrange manner, <hi>his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground:</hi> when he was upon the Croſſe he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> All this ſhews what a wonderfull ſuffering he had in his ſoul; which how great it was, only he knows that felt it. Let none marvell, that Chriſt ſhould be in ſuch perplexity of ſpirit, whereas uſually the Martyrs did ſhew no ſuch conſternation and amazement in their ſufferings, but did indure them with much patience, yea with much alacrity and chearfulneſſe, with much joy and gladneſſe: let none, I ſay, marvell at this, for the Martyrs were filled with inward joy and comfort, which did much mitigate, if not quite extinguiſh the ſenſe of their outward ſufferings; but it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with Chriſt, although the divine nature were
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:111827:84"/> perſonally united to the humane nature, yet it did for a while ſuſpend and withhold the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of conſolation. If <hi>Job</hi> being but tried of God, did yet ſo complain, ſaying, <hi>O that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances together; for now it would be heavier then the ſand of the Sea.</hi> Job. 6. 2, 3. And if <hi>David</hi> being chaſtned of God, did yet ſo cry out, ſaying, <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chaſten me in thy hot diſpleaſure; for thine arrows ſtick fast in me, and thine hand preſſeth me ſore: there is no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in my fleſh becauſe of thine anger, nor any reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſin,</hi> Pſal. 38. 1, 2, 3. How great needs muſt be Chriſts ſorrow, and the ſuffering of his ſoul, <hi>when it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him?</hi> Iſai. 53. 10. <hi>and to lay upon him the iniquities of us all,</hi> Iſai. 53. 6. Certainly if Chriſt had been a meer man, he had ſunk under the burthen, and had never been able to bear it; he could never have g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the efficient cauſes of Chriſts ſufferings, the inferiour and ſubordinate were Satan and wicked men. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh,</hi> Joh. 14. 30. <hi>The devil put it into the heart of</hi> Judas <hi>to betray him,</hi> Joh. 13, 2. <hi>The Kings of the earth stood up, and the Rulers were gathered together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt.

The ſuperiour cauſes were God and Chriſt himſelf. All thoſe that were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together againſt Chriſt, did but what God had before determined to be done, Act. 4. 28. When

               <hi>Pilate</hi> vaunted that he had power to crucifie Chriſt, and power to let him go, <hi>Thou couldeſt have no power over me</hi> (ſaid Chriſt again unto him) <hi>except it were given thee from above.</hi> Therefore<note place="margin">Joh. 7. 30. &amp; 8. 20.</note> we read in divers places, that though the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Chriſt indeavoured to lay hands on him, yet they could not, they had no power to do it, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his houre was not yet come,</hi> viz. the houre or time wherein God had appointed him to ſuffer, and ſo accordingly he was willing to ſuffer: for he did not ſuffer any thing but as himſelfe pleaſed, <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I may take it up again: No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelfe; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again: this Commandement I have received of my Father,</hi> Joh. 10. 17, 18. When they came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Chriſt, as they did, ſo little were they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do any thing unto him againſt his will, that no ſooner did he tell them, that he was the man whom they did ſeek, <hi>but they went back and fell to the ground,</hi> Joh. 18. 6. Beſides, as the ſtory there ſheweth, he knowing before hand vvhat things were to befall him, vvent forth to meet them, and to expoſe himſelf unto them. True it is, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that again and again, that the Cup might<note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> paſſe from him, that he might not ſuffer as he did, but it was ſtill upon ſuppoſition, if it might ſtand with the will of his Father, and with ſubmiſſion unto his vvill: conſidering the things vvhich he ſuffered in themſelves, ſo he vvould not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them; for it is naturall for every thing to deſire the preſervation of it ſelf; and Chriſt took
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:111827:85"/> upon him our nature, though not the ſinfulneſſe of our nature. <hi>He was tempted like unto us in all things, yet without ſin,</hi> Heb. 4. 15. But conſidering the things which he ſuffered, as ordained of God for him to ſuffer, ſo he was willing to ſuffer them, <hi>Nevertheleſſe not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> Mat. 26. 39. And v. 41. <hi>thy will be done,</hi> And Joh. 18. 11. <hi>The cup which my Father hath given me to drink, ſhall I not drink it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the finall cauſes of Chriſts ſufferings; they were Gods Glory, and mans Redemption.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods Glory. <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay, Father ſave me from this houre, but therefore came I to this houre: Father glorifie thy name,</hi> Joh. 12. 27. 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mans Redemption. He ſuffered to redeem man from ſin, <hi>He was wounded for our iniquities, he was bruiſed for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> &amp;c. Iſai. 53. 4; 5, 6. <hi>He himſelf bare our ſins on his body on the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. And ſo to redeem man from miſery: <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal 3. 13.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Are we burthened with ſin? do we groane under the heavy weight of it? Let's conſider what Chriſt hath ſuffered, and why he hath ſuffered. <hi>His ſoul was made an offering for ſin, Iſai.</hi> 53. 11. Not for any ſin of his own, for he had none, but for our ſin, as was before ſhewed; our ſin hath he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for by his ſuffering: For what can be the ſins of the ſons of men, for which the ſufferings of the Son of God are not a ſufficient ſatisfaction?</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:111827:86"/>
            <p>Therefore in all affliction and diſtreſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience lets flie unto Chriſt, lets roll our ſelves on him, and cleave to him, and we are ſafe.

We muſt take a holy revenge on our ſelves for our ſinners, 2. Cor. 7. 11. <hi>If we would judge our ſelves we ſhould not be judged of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 31. Becauſe we neglect to judge our ſelves, therefore God doth judge us, and lay his afflicting hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to bring us to a ſight and ſenſe of our ſins, that we may repent of them, and ſo not periſh in them. <hi>When we are judged, we are chaſtned of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32.

O let not us love that which God doth ſo hate, <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate evill,</hi> Pſal. 97. 10. Sin is evill in the ſight of God, let it be ſo in ours alſo, he hates ſin, and therefore let us alſo hate it; let us not make light of that which Chriſt found ſo heavy, let us remember what he ſaid as he went to the Croſſe, <hi>If they do theſe things in a green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?</hi> Luk. 22. 31. If Chriſt who himſelf had no ſin, did ſo ſuffer for ſin, what ſhal become of thoſe who are ful of nothing but ſin, &amp; wil ſtill go on to fill themſelves more &amp; more with it? <hi>O let us look on him whom we have pierced, and let us mourn for him</hi> (that is, for our ſins by which we have pierced him) <hi>as one mourneth for his only ſon, &amp; be in bitterneſſe for him, as one is in bitterneſſe for his firſt born,</hi> Zach. 12. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Finally, here we may ſee the wonderfull love of God, and of Chriſt towards us, that rather then we ſhould receive the juſt recompence and reward of our ſins, God would give his own Son, and Chriſt would give himſelf to ſuffer for us. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſon, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:111827:87"/> to love us, but to hate and abhor us. <hi>God commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his love towards us, in that whiles we were yet ſinners, Christ died for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us, and ſent his ſon into the world for us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 10. He adds v. 19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to do ſo, but ſo as to teſtifie our love by our obedience. <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandements,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandements,</hi> Joh. 14. 15. And as ſuch was the love of God and of Chriſt towards us, ſo we accordingly ought to love one another, <hi>If God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 11. <hi>Walk in love, as Christ alſo loved us, and gave himſelf for us,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>THe Apoſtle exhorting unto unity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, v. 1, &amp; 2. as a means conducing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he exhorts unto humility and lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind, v. 3. &amp; 4. And to incite unto this, he propounds the example of Chriſt, whom Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to imitate, v. 5. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewed how Chriſt humbled himſelf in being made man, he ſhewes how he humbled himſelf when he was made man, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as to be <hi>obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Being found in faſhion as a man,</hi>] This doth not import that Chriſt only had the ſhape and form of a man but was not man indeed, as ſome
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:111827:88"/> Heretikes have maintained: <hi>Every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi> (is true man, having true humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>is not of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 3. This particle <hi>as</hi> is not alwaies a meer note of ſimilitude, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is uſed to ſet forth the truth of a thing, as Joh. 1. 14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>as the glory, &amp;c.</hi> imports that the glory of Chriſt, which S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, was indeed the very glory of the only begotten Son of God. So <hi>Philem.</hi> v. 9. <hi>being ſuch a one as</hi> Paul <hi>the aged,</hi> ſaies <hi>Paul</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it is therefore as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>being</hi> Paul <hi>the aged.</hi> So likewiſe Mat. 14. 5. <hi>They counted him as a Prophet,</hi> it is ſpoken concerning <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and the meaning is, <hi>they counted him indeed a Prophet,</hi> as his Father <hi>Zacharias</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of him when he was newly born, ſaying, <hi>And thou child ſhalt be called the Prophet of the higheſt, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 1. 76. So here it being ſaid, that Chriſt was <hi>found in faſhion as a man,</hi> the meaning is, that he was very man indeed, like other men, ſin only excepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>The ſcope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew how low Chriſt did humble himſelfe: 1. Unto death. 2. Such a kind of death, even the death of the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore obſerve from hence, <hi>That Chriſt</hi>

               <hi>was obedient unto death:</hi> where three things are to be ſhewed, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That Chriſt did ſuffer death. And 2. That it was the will of God, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer death. And 3. That Chriſt in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:111827:89"/> to the will of God did ſuffer death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt did ſuffer death: So all the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts record, and ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3. So the Prophets fore-ſhewed, <hi>Saying none other things then thoſe which the Prophers and</hi> Moſes <hi>did ſay ſhould come, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, (viz.</hi> death, as appears by the words following, <hi>and that he ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead,</hi>) Acts 26. 22, 23. <hi>Daniel</hi> fore-told Chriſts death, ſaying, <hi>After threeſcore and two weeks ſhall Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah be cut off,</hi> Dan. 9. 26. So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> prophecied of him, ſaying, <hi>He was cut off out of the Land of the living,</hi> Eſa. 53. 8. And v. 12. <hi>He hath powred out his ſoul unto death.</hi> Chriſts death alſo was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in the Law, which was given by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of <hi>Moſes:</hi> all the ſacrifices were figures of Chriſts death, therefore he is called the <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. All the Lambs (and ſo other beaſts) that were ſacrificed in the time of the Law, did typifie and prefigure Chriſt, who as a Lamb was to be ſlaine and ſacrificed for us. The Author of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes ſhews Chriſt in this among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to have differed from the Prieſts that vvere in the Law, that whereas they offered of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Chriſt offered but once, and that becauſe he offered himſelf his offering was his ſuffering, ſo that if he ſhould have offered often, he muſt alſo have died often, whereas men uſe to die but once, and ſo was Chriſt to die, but not oft'ner. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But it may be objected, that ſome places of the Old Teſtament ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſeem to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:111827:89"/> import that he ſhould not die: <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 110. 4. <hi>His dominion is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting dominion, &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 7. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Indeed ſome from thoſe and the like places did inferre that Chriſt ſhould not die: For when they heard Chriſt ſpeak of his death, they objected againſt it, ſaying, <hi>We have heard out of the Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever,</hi> Joh. 12. 34. As if becauſe he ſhould abide for ever, as was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the <note n="*" place="margin">The Law is ſometimes put for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Joh. 15. 25. and 1 Cor. 14. 21.</note> Law, that is in the writings of the Old Teſtament, therfore he ſhould not die; but they erred, not rightly underſtanding the Scriptures which ſpeak of Chriſts abiding for ever. For the meaning of them is not, that Chriſt ſhould not die, but that although he did die, yet he ſhould ſoon riſe again, and ſo abide for ever: <hi>Chriſt being riſen from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him,</hi> Rom. 6. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was the will of God that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer death: There is nothing whatſoever comes to paſſe but by the will of God; <hi>Who hath ſaid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nihil fit niſi omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potens fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri velit, vel ipſe faciendo, vel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittendo ut fiat ab aliis. Aug.</note> 
               <hi>and it cometh to paſſe, and the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> Lam. 3. 37. otherwiſe then by the will and pleaſure of God not ſo much as a ſparrow doth fall to the ground, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 29. much leſſe could ſo great a thing as Chriſts death have been, had it not been the will and pleaſure of God that it ſhould be. <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned Chriſt to die, and others did execute the ſentence which <hi>Pilate</hi> had pronounced; but neither <hi>Pilate</hi> nor others did any thing to Chriſt, but as God had before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be done, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27, 28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It being the will of God, that Chriſt ſhould
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:111827:90"/> ſuffer death, Chriſt in obedience to the will of God did ſuffer it: <hi>This Commandement have I received of my Father,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 10. 18. viz.</hi> that he ſhould lay down his life, and therefore he would and did lay it down. And <hi>Joh. 18. 11. The cup which my Father hath given me to drinke, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Shall I not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death, ſeeing he will have me ſuffer it?</hi> True it is, Chriſt conſidering death in it ſelf, would have avoided it; but conſidering it as that which his Father would have him to ſuffer, ſo he was willing to ſuffer it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 39, 42.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But why would God have Chriſt to ſuffer death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. For the ſatisfying of his Juſtice: God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined &amp; declared death to be the puniſhment that ſhould be inflicted for ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. &amp; 3. 19. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 6. 33. Chriſt was to ſatisfie for ſin, and therefore he was to ſuffer death. <hi>His ſoul was made an offering for ſin,</hi> Eſa. 53. 10. <hi>Without ſhedding of blood is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> Heb. 9. 22. And v. 26. <hi>He appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi> Thus <hi>Chriſt died for our ſins, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 3. 2. God would have Chriſt to ſuffer death, for the magnifying of his mercy. <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love towards us,</hi> (ſets it out in this) <hi>that whiles we were yet ſinners, Christ died for us,</hi> Ro. 5. 8.</p>
            <p>By Chriſts death, firſt, we are reconciled unto God: <hi>When we were enemies we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. <hi>In whom we have redemption thorough his blood, even the forgiveneſs of our ſins, Col.</hi> 1. 14. And v. 21, &amp; 22. <hi>And you that were ſometimes alienated, and enemies in your mind thorough wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his fleſh through death.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:111827:90"/>
            <p>2. VVe are delivered from Satan. <hi>Now ſhall the Prince of this world be caſt out,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, when the time of his death was at hand, <hi>Joh. 12. 31. For aſmuch as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelfe took part of the ſame, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devill,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. The devill is there ſaid to have the power of death (though that properly belong unto God; for it is <hi>he that killeth, and he that maketh alive,</hi> 1 Sam. 26. Deut. 32. 39.) becauſe by the malice of the devill man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came guilty of ſin, and ſo liable unto death. Chriſt by his death hath vanquiſhed Satan, and freed thoſe that belong unto him from Satans power. Therefore they that believe in Chriſt, are ſaid to be brought <hi>from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Act. 26. 18. and to be <hi>delivered from the power of darkneſſe,</hi> Col. 1. 13.</p>
            <p>3. We have right unto eternall life. Had not Chriſt died, we had been uncapable of life, that life which is to come. This was ſignified by that <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Adam</hi> having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>God drove him out</hi> (viz. of Paradiſe) <hi>and he placed at the Eaſt of the garden of Eden, Cherubins, and a flaming ſword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life.</hi> By reaſon of ſin the life to come, eternall life (which was ſhadowed by that tree of life) was inacceſſible unto us, we could have no acceſſe unto it; but Chriſt by his blood hath made <hi>a new and living way for us,</hi> Heb. 10. 20. <hi>And for this cauſe he is the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the new Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions, that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:111827:91"/> were the first Teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternall inheritance,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. And in the two verſes following is ſhewed, why the new Covenant that God hath made with his people, is called a Teſtament, becauſe it is of force by Chriſts death. <hi>For where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the testator. For a Teſtament is of force after men are dead, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is of no ſtrength at all, whiles the teſtator li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi> Neither doth this make for the Popiſh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> as if before Chriſts death none did go to heaven, and enjoy the happineſſe of the life to come: <hi>For Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. The death of Chriſt was of force, as well before, as ſince Chriſts coming; they that did believe in Chriſt to come, did enjoy the benefit of his death, as well as they that now ſince his coming do believe in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But may ſome ſay, notwithſtanding Chriſts death, yet ſtill all die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, but not ſo as otherwiſe, had it not been for Chriſts death, they ſhould have died. For 1. By the death of Chriſt all that believe, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether freed from the ſecond death; <hi>over ſuch the ſecond death hath no power,</hi> Revel. 20. 6.</p>
            <p>2. The firſt death to believers is as no death, but an entrance into life, even life eternall. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in our Lord, from henceforth, yea ſaith the Spirit, that they may rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> &amp;c. Revel. 14. 13. The ſouls of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full being ſeparated from their bodies, do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enter into happineſſe, which made the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:111827:91"/> ſay, that to die was gain unto him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. And v. 23. that he deſired to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, which was far better. And the bodies of believers ſhall alſo in due time be raiſed up, and together with their ſouls be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of eternall bliſſe. Chriſt by his death hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome death, ſo that they that believe in him ſhall not be overcome by it, not ſo as for ever to remain under the power and dominion of it. <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I wil redeem them from death: O death I will by thy plagues; O grave I will be thy deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 14. To which place the Apoſtle allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, ſaying, <hi>O death where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy victory?</hi> And he addes, <hi>the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Here then is conſolation for us in reſpect of the guilt of ſin, and the fear of wrath as due for ſin. Do our conſciences accuſe us? doth Satan throw his fiery darts at us? The meditation and application of Chriſts death is ſufficient to quiet our conſciences, and to repell Satan and all his aſſaults: <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth. Who is he that</hi>

               <hi>condemneth? it is Chriſt that died,</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34. <hi>My conſcience</hi> (ſaies one) <hi>is troubled, but it ſhall not be orewhelmed: for I will remember the wounds of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> 3. But as Chriſt died for ſin, ſo muſt we die unto ſin; thus muſt we be conformed to his death, or els we can expect no benefit by it. <hi>We thus judge</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:111827:92"/> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that if one died for all, then were all dead; And that he died for all, that they that live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them, and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 15. They are therefore moſt fooliſh and abſurd, who think that becauſe Chriſt died for them, therefore they may live as they liſt. As if Chriſt by his death had purchaſed not freedome from ſin, but freedom to ſin: this is, <hi>to turn the grace of God into laſciviouſneſſe, and to deny the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Jude v. 4. But we have not ſo learned Chriſt, Epheſ. 4. 20. our very Baptiſm doth teach us another leſſon. The Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>Where ſin abounded, there grace hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded much more,</hi> Rom. 5. 20. To prevent the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of this doctrine, he addes preſently after; <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound? God forbid: How ſhall we that are dead unto ſin, live any longer therein? Know ye not that ſo many of us, as were baptized into Chriſt, were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptiſme into death, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 6. 1. 2, 3, 4. So Col. 3. 2, 3. <hi>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth, for ye are dead,</hi> viz. unto ſin, and v. 5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members that are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanneſſe, inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection, evill concupiſcence, and covetouſneſſe, which is idolatry.</hi> This mortifying of ſin, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto ſin, imports 1. A ſerious and ſetled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to eſchew ſin. I ſaid (that is, I purpoſed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved) <hi>I will take heed unto my waies, that I offend not with my tongue,</hi> Pſal. 39. 1. <hi>I am purpoſed, that my mouth ſhall not tranſgreſſe,</hi> Pſal. 17. 3.</p>
            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:111827:92"/>
            <p>2. A care to avoid the occaſions of ſin: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye wicked, for I will keep the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of my God,</hi> Pſal. 119. 115.</p>
            <p>3. A diligent uſe of the means whereby to ſubdue ſin: <hi>Thy Word have I hid within my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee,</hi> Pſal. 119. 11.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. As Chriſt was obedient unto death, ſo we muſt learne by his example to be obedient alſo as well in ſuffering as in doing, and that in ſuffering death it ſelf, if God call unto it; <hi>You have not yet reſiſted unto blood,</hi> Heb. 12. 4. As if he ſhould ſay, in obedience unto God you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, ſtriving (as there it followes) againſt ſin, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto blood, the ſhedding of your blood, if need be; ſo did Chriſt who is there propounded as a pattern for our imitation, <hi>Looking unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, &amp;c.</hi> v. 2. <hi>Conſider him,</hi> v. 3. Not that we are to expoſe our ſelves to danger when we may avoid it by good and honeſt means, without diſhonour to God and his truth: <hi>When they perſecute you in one City, flee into another,</hi> ſo did Chriſt counſell his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 23. And Chriſt himſelf did ſo, when ſome being offended at his Doctrine would have throne him down from the brow of the hill, on which the City was built, he convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe away from them, and eſcaped their hands, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 29, 30. And ſo when <hi>Paul</hi> was like to be apprehended by the Governour in Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, he was let down in a basket thorough a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and by that means eſcaped, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 32, 33. But if God call us to ſuffer, if it appear to be his will, if it cannot be avoided without diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God and his Goſpell, in this caſe we muſt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:111827:93"/> be willing to ſubmit unto God, and to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto death as Chriſt was, to lay down our lives for God, and for his truth as Chriſt did: <hi>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternall life, whereunto thou art alſo called, and haſt profeſſed a goood profeſſion before many Witneſſes. I give thee charge in the ſight of God, who quickneth all things, and before Ieſus Chriſt, who before</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>witneſſed a good confeſſion, that thou keep this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement without ſpot, unrebukeable, untill the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 6. 12, 13, 14. As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, Chriſt bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the truth before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> unto death; ſo muſt we alſo, if need be, bear witneſſe to it, though we die for it: <hi>He that loveth his life</hi> (to wit, inordinately, ſo as that he will not part with it when God doth call for it, but doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it before Gods glory, he that ſo loveth his life) <hi>ſhall loſe it; and he that hateth his life in this world, ſhall keep it unto life eternall,</hi> Joh. 12. 25. See the like ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 25. &amp; 10. 39. And Chriſt would have all that take upon them the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Name, to conſider this, that for his ſake they muſt be ready (if the caſe ſo require) to forgo whatſoever is neare and deare unto them, even life it ſelf. So S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſhewes us, ſaying, <hi>And there went great multitudes with him, and he turned &amp; ſaid unto them, If any man come to me, &amp; hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple, Luk.</hi> 14. 25. 26.</p>

            <p>THus the Apoſtle ſhews the greatneſſe of Chriſts humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and obedience, in that he not only humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and was obedient unto death, but ſuch a kind of death, <hi>even the death of the Croſſe,</hi> that is, death on the Croſſe; he was crucified, nailed alive to the Croſſe, and ſo did hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe untill he died.

            <p>For the firſt, That Chriſt ſuffered death upon the Croſſe, it is a thing clearly recorded by all the foure Evangeliſts, So <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles often ſpeaks of the Croſſe of Chriſt (that is, of Chriſts death on the Croſſe) and of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. See 1 Cor. 1. 18. 23. &amp; 2. 2. 8. Gal. 6. 14. Phil. 3. 18. So <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt bare our ſins on his body on the tree,</hi> that is, on the Croſſe, 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>David</hi> alſo prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of this, ſaying, <hi>They pierced my hands, and my feet,</hi> Pſal. 22. 16. He ſpake thoſe words prophetically in the perſon of Chriſt; as the very beginning of the Pſalm doth ſhew, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> which words (as the Evangeliſts record) Chriſt uttered, when he was upon the Croſſe. So v. 18. <hi>They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my veſture.</hi> Which (as appears likewiſe by the hiſtory of the Goſpell) was fulfilled in Chriſt, when he was crucified.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:111827:94"/>
            <p>Chriſt alſo himſelf did foretell what kind of death he ſhould ſuffer, to wit, the death of the Croſſe. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaid he to his Diſciples) <hi>We go up to Jeruſalem, and the Son of man ſhall be betrayed unto the chief Priests, and to the Scribes, and they ſhall condemn him to death. And they ſhall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to ſcourge, and to crucifie him.</hi> Mat. 20. 18, 19. So Joh. 12. 32, 33. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.</hi> That by his <hi>lifting up</hi> he meant lifting up upon the Croſſe, to die upon it, the Evangeliſt immediately declares, ſaying, <hi>This he ſaid, ſignifying what death he ſhould die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſts death upon the Croſſe was likewiſe typified, and prefigured by the brazen Serpent, of which we read, <hi>Num.</hi> 21. There the ſacred hiſtory tells us how God when the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſinned againſt God, and provoked him by murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he plagued them by ſending fiery Serpents among them; but in wrath remembring mercy, he commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to ſet upon a pole a brazen Serpent (the ſimilitude of a ſerpent made of braſſe) that whoſoever was ſtung by a fiery ſerpent, by looking up to that brazen ſerpent might be made whole: This brazen ſerpent ſo lifted up, was a type and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt lifted up upon the Croſſe, that whoſoever are ſtung by that old ſerpent the devill, may look up to him with the eye of faith, and be ſaved. This Chriſt himſelf doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie unto us, ſaying, <hi>As Moſes lift up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe, ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But it may be objected, that among the Jews this kind of death was not in uſe. The Iewiſh Talmud tells us, that<note place="margin">Sanhedr. c. 7.</note> they had foure kinds of capitall puniſhments, to wit, ſtoning, burning, killing with the ſword, and ſtrangling. They make no mention of crucifying; neither do we find it mentioned any where in the old Teſtament. There indeed we read of hanging, but it was not a hanging of any whileſt they were alive, but only a hanging of them after that they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe put to death, to wit, for the greater infamy of thoſe who were hanged, and for the greater terrour of others. <hi>Joſhua</hi> firſt ſmote and ſlew the five Kings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them upon trees untill evening; for by the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:111827:94"/> 23. none were to hang longer, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 10. 26. This hanging was quite another thing much different from crucifying. For they that were crucified were hanged alive, being nailed to a croſſe, and ſo did hang untill they were dead. It's ſaid indeed that the Iews ſlew Chriſt, and hanged him on a tree, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 30. &amp; 10. 39. But that is not ſo to be underſtood, as if they did firſt ſlay him, and then hang him on a tree, that had not been crucifying; neither doth that agree with the ſacred hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Goſpell. The meaning of thoſe places is, that they ſlew him by hanging him on a tree. The particle <hi>and</hi> in thoſe places is exegeticall or explicative rather then copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it ſhews how they flew him, to wit ſo, as that they hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him on a tree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some of the Iewiſh Rabbines indeed think by this argument (to wit that crucifying, or putting to death by hanging upon a Croſſe, was not uſed among the Iews) they think (I ſay) to convince the Goſpell of falſhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they bewray either their ignorance or malice, or both. For in the<note place="margin">

               </note> time of our Saviour, and ſome while before, the Iews were under the power and juriſdiction of the Romanes, as appears not only by the new Teſtament, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 1. 4, 5. &amp; 3. 1. and ſo other places; but alſo by forraign Writers, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> a Iew, and <hi>Tacitus</hi> a heathen man. Now crucifying was a puniſhment, which was much uſed among the Romanes; and they brought it into uſe among the Iews, when they had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them. And thoſe forementioned Authors, to wit <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> do both of them record how Chriſt was put to death by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> being Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<note place="margin">

Chriſt himſelf foretelling his death, and the manner of it, ſhewed how it ſhould come to paſſe, that he ſhould be crucified, to wit, that the Iews ſhould deliver him to the Gentiles, namely the Romanes, and they (as their cuſtom was) ſhould crucifie him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 18, 19. So it was, as the Evangeliſts relate. Pilate <hi>willing to content the people, releaſed</hi> Barabbas <hi>unto them, and delivered Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, when he had ſcourged him, to be crucified. And the ſouldiers led him away, &amp;c. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe from him, and put his own
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:111827:95"/> clothes on him, and led him out to crucifie him,</hi> Mar. 15. 15, 16, 20. S. <hi>John</hi> alſo having ſaid, that <hi>Pilate</hi> bade the Iews take Chriſt, and judge him according to their Law, and that the Iews anſwered, that it was not lawfull for them to put any man to death; he addes, <hi>That the ſaying of Jeſus might be fulfilled, which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhould die,</hi> Joh. 18. 31, 32. Chriſt had ſignified, that he ſhould die the death of the Croſſe, which was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by the Iewes delivering of Chriſt unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> who being a Roman, condemned him to that kind of death, which was in uſe among the Romans: <hi>Peter</hi> indeed told the Jewes, that they had crucified Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 22, 23. 36. &amp; 5, 30. But that was becauſe it was done thorough their inſtigation. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. And <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15. the Jewes are juſtly charged with it, becauſe they were the workers and procurers of it. Thus then the objection is ſufficiently anſwered, and the firſt thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded is ſufficiently cleared, to wit, that Chriſt ſuffered death on the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>2. The next thing to be conſidered is, that this was a great aggravation of Chriſts ſuffering: The Apoſtle (we ſee in the Text) aggravates his ſuffering by this, that he not only ſuffered death, but <hi>even the death of the Croſſe.</hi> This death was more grievous then other kinds of death in divers reſpects: For, firſt, it was a more painfull death;<note place="margin">

               <hi>He indured the Croſſe:</hi> So it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. which intimates that the death of the Croſſe was very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and hard to be indured. It is grievous to indure any death that is violent, but eſpecially the death of the Croſſe; to have the hands and the feet (which by reaſon of the multitude of ſinewes, are of all parts moſt ſenſible of pain) pierced thorough with nails, yea digged, as the word uſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 16. doth indeed ſignifie, and ſo to be faſtened to a Croſſe, and to hang for many hours together, this muſt needs be very dolourus and painfull: The Latine word for a Croſſe comes of a word that ſignifieth torment, of all puniſhments that of the Croſſe was accounted moſt bitter and moſt tormenting. And in the Scripture-phraſe the Croſſe is put for all affliction whatſoever; <hi>If any man will come after me</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>let him deny himſelf, and take
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:111827:95"/> up his Croſſe and follow me,</hi> Mat. 6. 24. And Luke 14. 27. <hi>Whoſoever doth not bear his Croſſe, and come after me, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> For one to beare his Croſſe, is as much as patiently to indure any affliction that ſhall come upon him.</p>
            <p>2. The death of the Croſſe was a moſt ſhamefull death: It's ſaid of Chriſt, that he <hi>indured the Croſſe, deſpiſing the ſhame,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. Any death that is inflicted as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ignominious, and carries ſhame along with it, but the death of the Croſſe eſpecially; it was called <hi>a ſlaviſh puniſhment,</hi> becauſe it was at firſt only inflicted on ſlaves, afterwards it was alſo inflicted on others, yet but ſeldome, and only<note place="margin">Servile ſupplicium. <hi>Lipſ. de cruce.</hi> Primùm receptum in ſervos iiſ<expan>

Such a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable act cannot by any word be ſufficiently expreſſed.</hi> What manner of perſons they did uſe to inflict this death of the Croſſe upon, we may ſee by thoſe who were crucified together with Chriſt; <hi>There were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left,</hi> Mat. 27. 38. They were thieves, robbers, murtherers, as the word in the Originall doth import: The word in the ſingular number uſed of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> is rendred <hi>a robber,</hi> Joh. 18. 40. And of this ſame <hi>Barabbas</hi> Acts 3. 14. it is ſaid, that he was <hi>a murtherer.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt Emperour that made publike profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that in honour of Chriſt he took away this kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:111827:96"/> (crucifying) ſo that ſince it hath not been uſed as before it was.</p>
            <p>3. It was a more curſed death. <hi>For he that is hanged, is accurſed of God,</hi> Deut. 21. 23. Every death inflicted as a puniſhment due to him, on whom it is inflicted, is a token and teſtimony of Gods curſe. But hanging more eſpecially, it expoſing a man more then ordinary to the open view of all, to take notice of him, as one whom God hath accurſed. This I take to be the reaſon, why he that is hanged, is rather then any other, ſaid to be accurſed of God, becauſe he more eſpecially is made a ſpectacle of Gods wrath and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us; for it is written, curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. The Apoſtle there alledgeth that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thence ſheweth why Chriſt ſuffered on the Croſſe rather then otherwiſe.

               </note> as death came by it: and that as Satan vanquiſhed man by a tree, ſo Chriſt by the ſame means might vanquiſh Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. But although Gods wiſdome and power in ſo ordering it, may thus be obſerved, yet the Scripture doth not aſſign theſe reaſons, but only the other, to wit, that ſo it might appear that Chriſt bare our ſins, and the curſe that was due unto us for them.</p>

Seeing Chriſt hath not only ſuffered, not only ſuffered death, but even the death of the Croſſe for us. Therefore if that old Serpent the devill ſting us, let us by faith look upon this brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Chriſt lift up upon the Croſſe, and then we ſhall be ſafe. Chriſt being crucified for us, <hi>hath blotted out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was against us, which was contrary unto us, and hath taken it out of the way, nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it unto his Croſſe. And having ſpoiled principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it,</hi> Col. 2. 14, 15.</p>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:111827:96"/>
            <p>2. In all outward troubles and afflictions. Do we ſuffer pain? Do we ſuffer ſhame? Why? did not Chriſt ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us? Yea, what is our ſuffering in compariſon of his ſuffering? Therefore <hi>let us run with parience the race that is ſet before us, Looking unto Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Croſſe, deſpiſing the ſhame,</hi> &amp;c. Heb 12. 1, 2. <hi>Paul</hi> though he ſuffered never ſo painfully, never ſo ſhamefully, yet gloried in Chriſt crucified, and abhorred to glory in any thing beſides. <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I ſhould glory in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, ſave in the Croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world,</hi> Gal. 6. 14. We read that when the Iſraelites paſſing through the wilderneſſe towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> came to a place where was<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 23. 25.</note> water, but bitter, that they could not drink of it, <hi>Moſes</hi> (as the Lord appointed) caſt in a tree into the water, and ſo it became ſweet. So whatſoever bitter waters of affliction we meet with, as we paſſe thorough the wilderneſſe of this world unto the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> let us caſt into them the tree on which Chriſt ſuffered, let us meditate of Chriſts ſuffering upon the Croſſe, and this will ſweeten all. Chriſt by his curſed death which he ſuffered, hath taken away the curſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all our ſuffering, ſo that all ſhall work together for our good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Therefore let us labour and have a care to know Chriſt crucified; let all our thoughts and meditations be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about him. <hi>I determined</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. He means that all his preaching and teaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ſhould aim at this, that they might rightly know Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified. The preaching of Chriſt crucified is that <hi>fooliſhneſſe of preaching</hi> (as the world ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it) <hi>by which it pleaſeth God to ſave them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21. <hi>For the preaching of the Croſſe</hi> (ſaith he there v. 18.) <hi>is fooliſhneſſe to them that periſh, but unto us which are ſaved it is the power of God.</hi> So again v. 23. &amp; 24. <hi>But we preach Chriſt crucified, unto the Jews a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſſe, But unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdome of God.</hi> True it is, we preach
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:111827:97"/> Chriſts Incarnation, and the holineſſe of his converſation whileſt he lived upon earth, his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, &amp;c. yet ſtill with reference to his Croſſe, either as going before, and making way for it; or as following after, and ſhewing the efficacy of it. Yea, we preach the Law, but with reference to Chriſt crucified; either to convince of ſin, and ſo to ſhew the need of Chriſt, or to preſerve from ſin, and to conform unto Chriſt. <hi>By the law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 3. 20. And ſo the Law is the rule of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, according to which Chriſt himſelf did walk, and ſo muſt they that are in Chriſt. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf to walk, even as he walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 6. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the Commandements of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 19. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh thorough love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new Creature.

Gal. 6. 15. 16. In a word, as Chriſt was crucified, ſo alſo muſt we be crucified, or els Chriſt crucified ſhal profit us nothing. <hi>Knowing this that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. 6. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſſe I live, yet not I but Chriſt doth live in me, and the life which I now live, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the Scripture doth teach us otherwiſe; <hi>viz.</hi> that it is faith in Chriſt crucified, and not the ſigne of the Croſſe, whereby we muſt reſiſt Satan, and whereby we muſt obtain of God whatſoever is requiſite and needfull for us: <hi>The devill your adverſary goeth about like a roaring Lion, &amp;c. Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8, 9. <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you,</hi> Joh. 16. 23. Again we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take heed and beware of the blaſphemy of the Socinians, who hold that Chriſt ſuffered death, even the death of the Croſſe, only to confirm his Doctrine, and to give us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, but not to bear the curſe that was due unto us, and ſo to ſatisfie the juſtice of God for us. But what more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Scripture, which ſaith that Chriſt was made ſin (that is, a <note n="*" place="margin">In the Hebrew the word that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth ſin, is often put for a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſin.</note> ſacrifice for ſin) and a curſe for us, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 24.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:111827:98"/> of it, amongſt the reſt this of Chriſts buriall, ſo that this is a point for Miniſters to preach, and for people to think of, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was buried. <label type="milestone">

            <p>This is recorded by all the Evangeliſts; and it was alſo long before ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death,</hi> Eſa. 53. 9. It was likewiſe prefigured in that which happened to the Prophet <hi>Jonas, For as</hi> Jonas <hi>was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly, ſo ſhall the Son of man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth,</hi> (that is, in the grave) ſaid Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 40.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> It may be objected, that ſuch as were crucified as Chriſt was, did not uſe to be buried, but were wont to hang upon the Croſſe untill they rotted, and to that end there were Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers<note place="margin">Solenne illud fuit, crucifixorum corpora militari cuſtodiâ ſignari, donec putruiſſent, ne quis ea ad ſepulturam detraheret. <hi>Lipſ.</hi>
               </note> appointed to watch them, leſt any ſhould come to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to bury them. Thus they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deal with thoſe that were crucified, as they relate who are verſed in the Antiquities of the Romanes, among whom crucifying was in uſe, and ſo (as before was ſhewed) they having dominion over the Jews, by that means it was that Chriſt was crucified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, that although that were the cuſtome of the Romanes not to permit thoſe whom they did crucifie to be buried, yet they were ſo indulgent to the Jews as to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to obſerve their owne Lawes which God preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto them. Now one Law which the Jewes were to obſerve, was this, that if any were hanged on a tree, he ſhould not hang all night, but be taken down at even, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. And ſo S. <hi>John</hi> relates, that the Jewes came to <hi>Pilate</hi> and deſired him <hi>that the bodies</hi> (of Chriſt, and the other that were crucified with him) <hi>might not remain on the Croſſe on the Sabbath day,</hi> which was the day after they were crucified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 31. There was then more eſpeciall cauſe why they deſired to have the bodies taken down, becauſe beſides that Law in <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> before mentioned, the day after was the Sabbath day, and an extraordinary Sabbath (as it is there ſaid, <hi>for that Sabbath day was an high day</hi>) by reaſon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:111827:98"/> of the feaſt of the Paſſeover, which alſo was at that time. But by this place of the Evangeliſt we may ſee that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were not ſo ſtrict with the Jewes, but that they would let them injoy their liberty in things that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their Religion. And moreover the Evangeliſts ſhew that there was ſpeciall leave given by <hi>Pilate</hi> the Romane Governour for Chriſts buriall, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 38. And the like may be ſeen in the other Evangeliſts.</p>
            <p>It was meet that Chriſt ſhould be buried: Firſt, for the greater certainty of his death, that it might the better appear that he was dead indeed, and not in appearance only; for none uſe to be buried, but ſuch as are firſt dead: And <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> was very carefull to be certified firſt of Chriſts death, before he would give leave that he ſhould be buried, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15. 43, 44, 45.</p>
            <p>2. For the greater certainty of his Reſurrection: And in this reſpect the Evangeliſts obſerve not only that Chriſt was buried, but alſo they record the circumſtances of his buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and ſhew how he was buried, <hi>viz. In a new ſepulchre wherein never man was laid,</hi> Joh. 19. 41, 42. That ſo none might cavill, and ſay, it was not Chriſt, but ſome other that<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact. ad loc.</note> did ariſe from the dead; and that none alſo might pretend that Chriſt did not riſe by his owne power, but by the touch of ſome other who had been buried in the ſame grave before: As we read of one, who being caſt into the grave where the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> was buried, by the touch of the dead bones of the Prophet revived, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 21.</p>
            <p>And again, the Evangeliſts record that Chriſt was laid in a ſepulchre which was hewen out of a Rock, and that a great ſtone was rolled to the door of the ſepulchre, and that the ſtone vvas ſealed, and a watch ſet to keep the ſepulchre, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 60, 66. So that it could not with any probability be pretended that either by undermining or otherwiſe, Chriſt was ſtolne out of the ſepulchre.</p>
            <p>3. Chriſts burial was a further degree of his humiliation: It was much for him to die, and more to die the death of the Croſſe, and yet more to condeſcend and ſtoop ſo low, as to be laid in the grave the common receptacle of the dead. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking of a man that is high and eminent in the world vvhile he liveth, ſhevves that yet vvhen he dieth he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:111827:99"/> ſhall be brought ſo low as to be laid in the grave: <hi>Who ſhal declare his way to his face? and who ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay him what he hath done? Yet ſhall he be brought to the grave, and ſhal remain in the tomb, the clods of the valley ſhall be ſweet unto him,</hi> &amp;c. Iob 21. 31, 32, 33.</p>
            <p>4. This ſerved to make Chriſts victory over death, &amp; <hi>over him that had the power of death,</hi> that is, the Devill, the more glorious; that he not only died, but alſo was buried; death ſeemed to have ful conqueſt over Chriſt, having gotten him into its den, yet even there did Chriſt vanquiſh and ſubdue it: Thus did he moſt gloriouſly triumph, fulfilling that, <hi>O death, I will be thy plague, O grave, I will be thy deſtruction,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This point concerning Chriſts buriall doth make much for the confirming of our faith in Chriſt, to aſſure us that our ſins are fully expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and aboliſhed by Chriſt, that as they were nailed to his Croſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. ſo alſo buried in his grave, never to riſe up againſt us to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Chriſt bare our ſins in his body on the tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. Therefore Chriſt being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; our ſins alſo were buried with him, ſo that we being united by faith unto Chriſt, and having intereſt in him, we are freed from ſin, and need<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.</note> not fear the imputation of it. <hi>Ionah</hi> being caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea, and buried as it were in the belly of the fiſh, preſently the ſtorm ceaſed, and the Sea was calm. So Chriſt being laid in the grave and buried, our conſciences, though otherwiſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the guilt of ſin, full of vexation and horror, have good cauſe to be calm and quiet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Again, here is good comfort and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:111827:99"/> for us (if we belong to Chriſt) againſt the fear of death, and the horrour of the grave. Chriſt hath grapled with death and the grave, and hath overcome them, and therefore we need not to be afraid of them, Chriſt having followed death into its den; and there gotten victory over it: we may aſſure our ſelves, that though death prevail ſo far over us, as to draw us into it's den, yet it ſhall not be able to keep us there, but Chriſt will make good that which is promiſed, Hoſ. 13. 14. <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave, I wil redeem them from death.</hi> So Chriſt aſſures us, that <hi>the houre is coming in the which all that are in the grave ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth,</hi> Joh. 5. 28. 29. In like manner the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Then ſhall be brought to paſſe the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory. O death where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law. But thanks be unto God, who giveth us victory thorough Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 54, 55, 56, 57. The graves of the Saints are called beds wherein they lie and reſt for a while, but at length ariſe and come out of them. <hi>They ſhall reſt in their beds,</hi> Iſai, 57. 2. So by Eccleſiaſticall writers burying places<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Caemite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</note> are expreſſed by a word that properly ſignifies pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſleep in, even as in Scripture death is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally termed ſleep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. But if we would have ſuch hope in Chriſt, in that he was buried, then we muſt be conformed unto him in reſpect of his buriall; as he was buried literally, ſo muſt we be buried myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. <hi>We are buried with him by baptiſme,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:111827:100"/> the Apoſtle, Rom. 6. 4. Our Baptiſm is a ſeal of our ingrafting into Chriſt, and of our communicating with him, and conforming unto him even in his buriall. So Col. 2. 12. <hi>Buried with him in baptiſme,</hi> This is in reſpect of <hi>our old man,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. that is, our corrupt nature, this muſt be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, mortified and buried, ſo as <hi>not to ſerve ſin,</hi> as there the Apoſtle doth expreſſe it. Even as a dead body is laid in the ground, and overwhelmed with earth, ſo the corruption that is in us, muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and brought under, that it may not reign in us, nor have dominion over us. <hi>Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortall body,</hi> Rom. 6. 12. The greateſt tyrants and oppreſſours being in the grave, all their tyranny and oppreſſion ceaſeth. <hi>There the wicked ceaſe from troubling,</hi> Joh. 3. 17. So we being in the ſenſe before expreſſed, by way of analogy and reſemblance buried with Chriſt, ſin ſhall not have that power over us, as over the unregenerate. I ſay, not ſo, as over the unregenerate. But we muſt not think that whiles we are here, we can be ſo conformed unto Chriſt, ſo dead and buried with him as to be without ſin, to be quite free from it. No, <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 8. <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> Iam. 3. 2. But if we have the ſpirit of Chriſt (<hi>And if any have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9.) then we are ſo in a ſpirituall ſenſe dead and buried with Chriſt, as not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reigning power of ſin, and the dominion of it. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14.</p>
            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:111827:100"/>
            <p>Again, there is not the like reaſon of ſpirituall death and buriall, and of that which it corporall. For corporal death and buriall is finiſhed at once; but not ſo that which is ſpirituall; this is done by degrees, by little and little: He that is already dead and buried in a ſpirituall ſenſe, that is, he whoſe old man, whoſe imbred corruption is as it were put to death, and laid in the grave, yet muſt ſtill die in that kind, and be buried ſtill more and more, becauſe he hath ſtill ſome reliques of the old man, ſtill ſome ſin and corruption remains in him. The Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>ye are dead,</hi> Col. 3. 3. Yet addes v. 3. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider this; we profeſſe our ſelves Chriſtians, Diſciples, and followers of Chriſt, and ſo conſequently dead and buried with him. If then we walk in ſin, we make our ſelves prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: for is it not a prodigious thing for one that is dead and buried, yet to walk as if he were alive? O then as we have put on Chriſt by profeſſion, and ſo at leaſt <hi>all that are baptized into Christ, have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 27. Let us alſo put on Chriſt by imitation, conforming our ſelves unto him, and walking as he walked. Of this putting on of Chriſt the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and to it he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts ſaying, <hi>Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting and in drunkenneſſe, not in cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. In the laſt place, the doctrine of Chriſts
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:111827:101"/> burying may ſerve for our information. As 1. That it is a Chriſtian courſe to bury the dead: Nature it ſelf doth teach ſo much, and much more Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that the dead ought to be buried. The Saints have ſhewed a ſpeciall care to perform their duty in this reſpect. <hi>Sarah</hi> being dead, <hi>Abraham</hi> was very carefull to have her buried. <hi>I am a ſtranger and a ſojourner with you</hi> (ſaid he to the Hittites) <hi>give me a poſſeſſion of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my ſight,</hi> Gen. 23. 4. And it is obſervable, that he purchaſed nothing in the Land of Canaan, but only the place there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of to bury in. So <hi>Stephen</hi> being ſtoned to death, <hi>devout men carried him to be buried,</hi> Act. 8. 2. It's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſmael,</hi> that when <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father was dead, they buried him, Gen. 25. 9. And ſo of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> that they did the ſame for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 35. 29. Though <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were prophane perſons (Gal. 4. 29. Heb. 12. 16.) yet they joyned with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who were godly, in the burying of their Father: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which we read in the Goſpell, that when Chriſt called one to follow him, and he deſired firſt to go and bury his Father, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Let the dead bury the dead;</hi> That, I ſay, is not ſo to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as if Chriſt did condemn, or vilifie the office of burying the dead, as if this care did not become the godly. For (as the Apoſtle ſaith in another<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> caſe) He that neglects this, <hi>hath denied the faith, and is worſe then an infidell,</hi> becauſe he omits that which even infidells will be carefull to perform: But it was only the intent and meaning of Chriſt, to teach that all carnall affections muſt be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:111827:101"/> and nothing muſt hinder us from following Chriſt, when he doth call, nor from doing that which he doth enjoyn. How far Chriſt was from intending to diſparage the office of burying the dead, may appear by that which he ſpake in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Mary,</hi> whom ſome excepted againſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the precious ointment that ſhe had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon him, ſaying, that it might better have been ſold, and the money given to the poor, <hi>Let her alone</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>for againſt the day of my burying hath ſhe done this,</hi> Joh. 12. 7. They are therefore inhumane, who not content with the death of thoſe whom they hate and perſecute, wil not ſuffer them to be buried, or not to reſt when they are buried. This indeed is a puniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt, and inflicted upon ſome for the example of others. <hi>He ſhall be buried with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of an aſſe, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jeruſalem,</hi> Jer. 22. 19. <hi>Their dead bodies ſhal be for meat to the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth,</hi> Jer. 32. 20. <hi>And as</hi> Joſiah <hi>turned himſelf, he eſpied the Sepulchers that were there in the mount, and he ſent and took the bones out of the Sepulchers, and burnt them upon the Altar, &amp;c.</hi> 2 King. 23. 16. God had long before declared, that <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſhould thus deal with the dead bones of Idolaters, 1 Kings 13. 2. But what doth this make for them, who deal thus even with the Saints, whoſe death is precious in the ſight of the Lord? This the Pſalmiſt complains ſore of, <hi>The dead bodies of thy ſervants have they given to be meat to the fowls of the heavens, the fleſh of thy Saints unto the beaſts of the earth. Their blood have
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:111827:102"/> they ſhed like water round about Ieruſalem, and there was none to bury them,</hi> Pſal. 79. 2, 3. Thus barbarouſly did they of the Romiſh Church here in the time of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> deal with thoſe worthy men <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Fagius,</hi> they digged up their dead bodies out of their graves, and conſumed them in the fire: and this inhumanity have ſome uſed towards the dead, out of a deſire to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on them to the uttermoſt; as it is ſaid of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> that he cauſed the dead body of <hi>Marius</hi> his adverſary to be digged up. And ſo Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> the third is reported to have dealt in like manner with his Predeceſſour <hi>Formoſus,</hi> whom he hated, becauſe he had gotten the Papal dignity before him.</p>
            <p>2. From Chriſts burying, we may learn that the cuſtome of the Country (having nothing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, nor uncomely in it) is in this reſpect to be obſerved: It is ſaid that for the manner of Chriſts burying, it was <hi>as the manner of the Iews was to bury</hi> Joh. 19. 40. Whence <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves, <hi>that in thoſe offices</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caution.</hi> But concerning buriall, this caution is requiſite, not to think any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more aliens from Chriſt, if they be not buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all, or but meanly buried; nor therefore to think any the nearer unto Chriſt, if they have a ſumptuous and ſtately buriall. The Papiſts are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuperſtitious in this, thinking it to concern the welfare of the ſoul, to be buried rather in one
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:111827:102"/> place then in another. Purgatory is the ground of this conceit, but Purgatory it ſelf hath no ground in Scripture for it. The Scripture tels us, that when<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 7.</note> a man dies, as the body goeth to the earth, ſo the ſoul goes to God, <hi>viz.</hi> to be judged by him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhal the ſoul fare better or worſe, whether the body be buried or not, or buried after this, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner. We read of the rich mans burying, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. yet his ſoul went to hell: We read not of any buriall that <hi>Lazarus</hi> had, yet his ſoul was carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. True it is, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks of old were very ſolicitous about their burying in the Land of Canaan, though they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 29, 30, 31, &amp; 49. 29. &amp;c. And 50. 26. But that was not out of any ſuperſtitious opinion that they had, as if the welfare of their ſouls did depend upon the place where they were buried, but only to ſhew that they died in faith, being fully aſſured that God would at length per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he had promiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would give them (in their poſterity) the Land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: <hi>God will ſurely viſit you,</hi> ſaid Joſeph, ſpeaking of this very thing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 25. And beſides they looked on Canaan, not as a bare earthly Countrey, but as a type of heaven.

            <p>THe Article of Chriſts deſcending into hell, is grounded upon this Text, wherein as <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſhews, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 25. &amp;c. <hi>David</hi> ſpake concerning Chriſt. And therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> might<note place="margin">Quis niſi infidelis nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit fuiſſe apud inferos Chriſtum? Aug. Epiſt. 99.</note> wel ſay, who but an infidel wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that Chriſt was in hell? For this, that Chriſts ſoul ſhould not be left in hell, doth neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe that his ſoul was in hell: For it is moſt irrational and abſurd, to ſay that one ſhall be left there, where he never was, nor ſhould be. All therefore (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obſerves)<note place="margin">Omnes conveniunt, quòd Chriſtus aliquo modo ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feros deſcenderit. Bell. de Chriſti anima lib. 4. cap. 6.</note> agree in this, that Chriſt ſome way, in one ſenſe or other, was in hell. But for the manner how Chriſt was in hell, there is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among Divines; and all ariſes from the word <hi>hell,</hi> which ſome take in one ſenſe, and ſome in another, I ſhall as briefly, and perſpicuouſly as I
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:111827:103"/> may ſet down the ſeveral opinions, that there are about this point, confuting thoſe which I hold to be erroneous, and confirming that which I judge to be true.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, becauſe the word <hi>Hell</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<note place="margin">The firſt opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Chriſts deſcending into hell.</note> in Scripture uſed metaphorically, for moſt great &amp; grievous affliction, which is indured here in this life, (<hi>the ſorrows of hell compaſſed me about,</hi> ſaies <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 18. 5. So Pſal. 116. 3. <hi>The pains of hell got hold on me.</hi>) Some by Chriſts deſcending into hell ſpoken of in the Creed, underſtand the inward ſufferings of Chriſts ſoul, which of all his ſufferings were moſt grievous. But to omit other arguments againſt this opinion, it is ſufficiently overthrown by this, that theſe words of <hi>David (Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell)</hi> as cited and expounded by <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> are the ground of that Article in the Creed; for elſe it hath no ground in Scripture, as I think I am ſure, there is no place which doth ſo clearly hold out unto us by neceſſary conſequence Chriſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in hell, as this doth. And therefore though <hi>Calvin,</hi> (a prime Author of this firſt opinion, and a man moſt deſervedly renowned in the Church of God) ſpake conſentaneouſly to his opinion, when in his Commentary upon this ſixteenth Pſalm, he liked not that upon occaſion of theſe words of <hi>David,</hi> any ſhould fall upon the point of Chriſts deſcending into hell, which is mentioned in the Creed, yet I can by no means aſſent unto him. For if not theſe words of <hi>David</hi> which we have now in hand, no place in all the Scripture (I dare ſay) will afford occaſion to treat of the Article. But it
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:111827:104"/> appears that <hi>Calvin</hi> (being a man very acute) did well perceive that theſe words of <hi>David, Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell,</hi> as commented upon <hi>Act.</hi> 2. will not admit, that Chriſts deſcending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell ſhould be expounded of the ſufferings of Chriſts ſoul. For by <hi>hell</hi> in the words of <hi>David,</hi> muſt needs be meant ſomething that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Chriſt when he was dead: <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that in thoſe words (<hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell</hi>) David <hi>ſpake of the Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> Act. 2. 31. Now if this, that Chriſts ſoul ſhould not be left in hell, import that Chriſt ſhould riſe from the dead, then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that Chriſts being in hell, which is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Davids</hi> words, imports ſomething that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him being dead: And conſequently the ſufferings of Chriſts ſoul, which were before his death, cannot be meant by it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Papiſts take hell here for <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> 
               <hi>Patrum,</hi> as they call it, a place where they ſay the ſouls of the godly that died before Chriſt, were. For they divide hell into four ſeverall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, 1. The hell of the damned, the place of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall torment, 2. Purgatory, where they ſay the ſouls of ſuch are as were not ſufficiently purged from their ſins, whiles they were upon earth, and therefore for the thorough purging of them, are there in torment equall for the time to that of the damned, 3. <hi>Limbus Infantium,</hi> a place where they place ſuch Infants as die without baptiſme, whom they make to ſuffer the loſſe of heaven and heavenly happineſſe, but no pain or torment, 4. <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> where in like manner the Fathers
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:111827:104"/> before Chriſt (as they hold) were, ſuffering no pain, but only wanting the joys of heaven. To that place (ſay they) did Chriſts ſoul when it was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his body, deſcend, to deliver the ſouls from thence, and to carry them to heaven; this is their opinion, and their expoſition of the Article of Chriſts deſcending into hell.</p>
            <p>But not now to conteſt with them about thoſe other regions of hell, <hi>viz.</hi> Purgatory and <hi>Limbus Infantium,</hi> as for this <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> it is a place of their own deviſing, we ſee no ground for it in Scripture, but ſtrong reaſons againſt it. For 1. Chriſts death was efficacious to believers before his coming, as well as it is now ſince his coming. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. <hi>We believe that thorough the grace of our Lord Jeſus Christ, we ſhall be ſaved even as they,</hi> ſaid <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe that were before Chriſt. He doth but equall us to them in point of ſalvation thorough Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. The faithfull before Chriſt did account this life upon earth a pilgrimage, and did expect hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as their country, when this life was ended. <hi>Theſe all died in faith</hi> (it is ſpoken of <hi>Abraham I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob) having not received the promiſes</hi> (that is, the things promiſed) <hi>but ſaw them afar off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek a Countrey. And truly if they had been mindfull of that country, from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they deſire a better country, that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:111827:105"/> is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a City,</hi> Heb. 11. 11. 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome (as the place is called, where the ſouls of the godly were before Chriſt) could be no ſuch place as that which they call <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi> For 1. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Angels, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22. But Angels (the good Angels, as they were) ſhould rather carry to heaven then to hell, as they make their <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> to be. 2. It was a place of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 25. But where hell<note place="margin">Nondum inveni, &amp; adhuc quaero, nec mihi occurit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feros alicubi in bono poſuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Scripturam duntaxat Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicam, non autem in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no accipiendum ſinum Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hae, &amp; illam requiem, quò ab angelis pius pauper ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus eſt, neſcio utrùm quiſquam poſſit audire.

There was a great ſpace, <hi>a great gulfe</hi> betwixt the place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome where <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was, and the place of torment where the rich man was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 26.

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:111827:105"/> did gather, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome was no part of hell; neither doth he, nor any other that I know, indeavour to anſwer the reaſons that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>Austine</hi> to be of this judgement.</p>
            <p>4. Chriſt promiſed to the believing thief, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe (handling another<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellar.</hi> de Beatitud. Sanct. l. 1. c. 3.</note> point) holds Paradiſe there to be heaven, as the word is uſed; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. compared with v. 2. Now how doth this ſtand with that aſſertion of theirs, that the ſouls of the Saints were not in heaven untill Chriſts aſcenſion? or that Chriſts ſoul went to <hi>Limbus,</hi> a place very farre diſtant and different from heaven? Some ſay, that the Thief to whom Chriſt ſpake, deſcended with Chriſt into <hi>Limbus,</hi> and that it was then Paradiſe when Chriſt was there: But this (as a reverend Author ſaith well)<note place="margin">
                  <hi>B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> of Chriſts deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell. <hi>Bellar.</hi> de beat. Sanc. l. 1. c. 6.</note> is to turn the third heaven into the third or fourth hell.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proves that the faithfull now ſince the coming of Chriſt; go immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death to heaven, (except Purgatory ſtop them a while) and that becauſe God is not more prone and ready to puniſh, then he is to reward; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing the wicked go immediately to hell, there is no reaſon to conceive but that the godly go immediately to heaven. And that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they die go immediately to hell, he proves by the example of the rich man mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. Now if this argument be of force, (as I grant it is) then it proves as much for the faithfull that were before Chriſt: For that of the rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. ſhewes that then (before
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:111827:106"/> Chriſts death) the wicked immediately after death went to hell, where the damned are in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and neither will the Papiſts however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that. And therefore why ſhould they deny that the godly then did go immediately to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, God being no leſſe ready to reward, then to puniſh? Theſe reaſons there are againſt that <hi>Limbus</hi> which they ſpeak of, and ſo againſt their Expoſition of the Article of Chriſts deſcending into hell: But ſome Objections they make, which are to be anſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> They object that <hi>Gen. 37. 53. I will go down to the grave</hi> (to hell, as they read it) <hi>to my Son,</hi> &amp;c. Thus ſpake <hi>Iacob</hi> concerning his ſon <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when his brethren had ſold him, and made <hi>Jacob</hi> believe that ſome wild beaſt had devoured him. The Hebrew word there uſed viz. <hi>Sheol,</hi> which we ſometimes tranſlate grave, ſomtimes hell, they ſay cannot there ſignifie grave, but muſt ſignifie hell, <hi>viz.</hi> that part of hell, which they call <hi>Limbus Patrum; Jacobs</hi> meaning (ſay they) was that he would go mourning thither, whither <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> (as he ſuppoſed) was gone before him: And they prove that the grave cannot there be meant, becauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> imagined <hi>Ioſeph</hi> torne in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by ſome wild beaſt, and ſo not to have been buried.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this place makes nothing for their purpoſe; all that <hi>Iacob</hi> meant was, that in vain did they go about to comfort him, for he would not be comforted, but would mourn unto death, even as <hi>Joſeph</hi> (he thought) was dead: It's not unuſuall for thoſe that mourn for their friends
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:111827:106"/> being dead, to ſay that they will go unto them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aben Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae</hi> a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rabbin doth upon that very place <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 33. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them that take <hi>Sheol</hi> for hell. See <hi>B. Uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of Chriſts deſcent.</note> meaning that they alſo will die as they died: As for the word <hi>Sheol,</hi> it ſignifies the eſtate of the dead, (as hereafter I ſhall ſhew) and ſo the grave, yet not properly an artificiall grave, but a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grave, ſuch an one as nature one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth provide for every one, whatſoever the manner of his death be. It's reported of the Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canians, that they were ſo barbarous, as to caſt dead bodies unto doggs to be devoured: And that thereupon <hi>Diogenes</hi> uſed to ſay, that if he were torne in pieces by dogs, yet he ſhould have an Hyrcanian buriall; ſo if <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by a wild beaſt, the very belly of the beaſt had been a grave unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But again, they object likewiſe that Joh. 14. 2. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you;</hi> thence they infer, that before Chriſts aſcenſion none did go to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this inference is not good; for (as was ſhewed before) Chriſts death, and ſo his reſurrection and his aſcenſion was effectuall from the beginning; as by vertue of Chriſts death the faithfull that were before Chriſt, had their ſins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſo alſo by vertue of his aſcenſion did they go to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But (ſay they againe) the Scripture plainly tells us, that <hi>the way into the holieſt of all was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was yet ſtanding;</hi> therefore during that time none did go to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth not follow; the meaning of thoſe words is only this, (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> himſelf<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acquin.</hi> ad loc.</note>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:111827:107"/> doth expound them) that Chriſt who is the way, as he ſtiles himſelf, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 6. was not then in the time of the Law ſo clearly revealed, as now he is in the time of the Goſpell; before he was ſet forth more darkly under types and figures, but now is plainly preached. And ſo much for this ſecond Opinion touching Chriſts deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſome taking the word <hi>hell</hi> for the<note place="margin">The third Opinion.</note> hell of the damned, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ace where the damned are in torment, (which is the moſt uſuall accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Engliſh word <hi>hell</hi>) conceive and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that when Chriſt died his ſoul went thither, there to triumph over Satan in his own Palace; and this they hold to be the meaning of that in the Creed, <hi>He deſcended</hi> into hell: But that ever Chriſt was in that hell, I can make no part of my Creed; for I ſee nothing in Scripture (upon which faith muſt be grounded) for it, but much againſt it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Hebrew word <hi>Sheol,</hi> and the Greek word <hi>Hades,</hi> which are tranſlated <hi>hell,</hi> do not properly ſignifie the hell of the damned, but are of a more large extent, as I ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The foure Evangeliſts (as we uſe to call them) <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> writing profeſſedly the Hiſtory of our Saviour Chriſt from his Incarnation to his Aſcenſion, do neither directly, nor by conſequence, neither expreſſely nor implicitely record any ſuch thing as his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hell, as hell is taken for the place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it is obſervable, that S. <hi>Luke</hi> in his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:111827:107"/> Preface to his Goſpell tells <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that he did write unto him that he might know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of thoſe things wherein he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 4. wherein he had been catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as according to the Originall it doth ſound;<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. S. <hi>Paul</hi> rehearſing the chiefe heads of the Goſpel which he preached to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> mentioneth Chriſts death and buriall, and his reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4. but for his going to hell according to this Expoſition, he neither expreſſeth nor implyeth any ſuch matter. So that it was no part of the Goſpell which <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and yet there was no defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in his preaching, it was ſufficient to ſave them, v. 2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Theſe words of the Text in hand, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell,</hi> together with S. <hi>Peters</hi> comment upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. ſhew, that by <hi>hell</hi> is not to be underſtood the hell of the damned, according to this Expoſition.</p>
            <p>For, 1. It is ſpoken of as a great benefit, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of joy and rejoycing, that Chriſts ſoul was not left in hell; <hi>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory [my tongue,</hi> Acts 2. 26.] <hi>rejoyced: my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope; for thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 16. 9, 10. But is it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſuch a benefit, ſuch a matter of joy and gladneſſe for one not to be left in that place, to which he goeth to that end that he may triumph over his adverſaries whom he hath conquered?
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:111827:108"/> as they that imbrace this Expoſition ſay that Chriſt went to the hell of the damned, there to triumph over the Devills.</p>
            <p>2. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 2. 31. ſaith, <hi>David</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in hell,</hi> did ſpeak of Chriſts Reſurrection, and ſo to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to prove the Reſurrection of Chriſt, S. <hi>Paul Acts</hi> 13. 35. doth cite the later part of the Verſe, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But Chriſts Reſurrection though it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his being in hell in ſome ſenſe, yet not in that ſenſe as hell is taken for the place where the damned are in torment: Chriſt might well enough as he did, riſe againe, and yet never be in that hell.</p>
            <p>3. That hell that Chriſt was not left in, <hi>David</hi> was left in, elſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> could not argue as he doth, that <hi>David</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in hell,</hi> ſpake of Chriſt, and not of himſelfe; for that the words being underſtood of <hi>David</hi> are not true, but moſt true as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Chriſt: <hi>Men and brethren,</hi> ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> to the Jews, <hi>let me freely ſpeak unto you of the Patriarch</hi> David, <hi>that he is both dead, buried, and his Sepulchre remaineth with us to this day; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being a Prophet, and knowing that God had ſworne with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loines according to the fleſh, he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit upon his Throne; He ſeeing this before, ſpake of the Reſurrection of Christ, that his ſoul ſhould not be left in hell, nor his fleſh ſee corruption,</hi> Acts 2. 29, 30, 31. By <hi>Davids</hi> Sepulchre remaining with them, to that day, S. <hi>Peter</hi> means that <hi>David</hi> was left in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:111827:108"/> the hell which he ſpeaks of, and therefore did not ſpeak of himſelf, but of Chriſt, who was not left in it. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> having cited the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following theſe of the Text, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> he alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that this was meant of Chriſt, and not of <hi>David; For</hi> David (ſaith he) <hi>after he had ſerved his own generation by the will of God, fell on ſleep, and was laid with his fathers, and ſaw corruption: But he whom God raiſed again, ſaw no corruption,</hi> Acts 13. 35, 36, 37. <hi>David</hi> ſpake not of himſelf, but of Chriſt, when he ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> becauſe <hi>David</hi> did ſee corruption, but Chriſt did not ſee it; ſo <hi>David</hi> ſpake not of himſelf, but of Chriſt, when he ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell;</hi> becauſe <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul was left in hell, but Chriſts ſoul was not left in it: This is the Apoſtles argument, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily evinceth, that by hell here ſpoken of, is meant ſome other thing then the place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for <hi>Davids</hi> ſoule was not left in that hell, it never came into it; that hell belonging not to the godly and elect, but to the wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate: Therefore neither is this the hell in which (as the words imply) Chriſts ſoule was for a while, though it did not remaine there.</p>
            <p>5. This Expoſition of Chriſts deſcending into the hell of the damned there to triumph, makes his deſcending into hell a part of his exaltation; for it's ones exaltation to triumph over his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But Chriſts deſcending into hell expreſſed in the Creed, and intimated in the Scripture, was
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:111827:109"/> a part of his humiliation. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell:</hi> ſurely it was a part of Chriſts humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to be there, ſeeing he ſpeaks of it as a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and an argument of his joy and gladneſſe (as before noted) that he was not to be left there. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Chriſts Reſurrection was the beginning, and<note place="margin">

Evang. lib. 10.</note> the firſt ſtep of his exaltation, &amp; therefore what went before his Reſurrection, as his deſcending into hell did, belonged to his humiliation. The Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>Chriſt humbled himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe,</hi> Phil. 2. 8. And it is unqueſtionable, that Chriſts death was a part, and a chief part of his humiliation. Therefore ſo long as he remained dead, that is, untill his Reſurrection, he was in the eſtate of humiliation.</p>
            <p>6. It appears by Scripture, that when Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſoul went to heaven, and therefore not to hell, as taken for the place of torment, which is moſt oppoſite and contrary unto heaven. <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to the penitent malefactour. Therefore Chriſts ſoul being ſeparated from his body, went to Paradiſe, which is all one with the third [that is, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt] heaven, as was before ſhewed. Some anſwer that Chriſt meant of himſelf in reſpect of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, which is in all places, and in Paradiſe or heaven in a more eſpeciall manner; in that reſpect (they ſay) Chriſt did promiſe the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant thief that he ſhould be with him that day in Paradiſe. But firſt, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth well refell this<note place="margin">

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:111827:109"/> nature, Chriſt was with the thief here in this world, even then when he played the thief; ſo that in this ſenſe Chriſt in thoſe words (<hi>with me</hi>) had promiſed no new thing unto him. 2. The word of Chriſt cannot without doing violence unto them be otherwiſe taken, then to import this, that as the thief was then in reſpect of the body, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with Chriſt in pain and torment, ſo that ſame day both their ſouls ſhould be together, where they ſhould injoy bliſſe and happineſſe. Some therefore yeelding that thoſe words, <hi>with me,</hi> have reference to Chriſt in reſpect of his ſoul, ſay that Chriſts ſoul betwixt his death and his Reſurrection, might be both in heaven, and in hell the place of torment, one while in the one, another while in the other.

In thoſe words of Chriſt which are objected, by <hi>the heart of the earth</hi> is meant the grave. For Chriſts abiding ſo long in the heart of the earth, was to be a ſign to the Jews (as the context ſheweth) therefore it was to be a thing apparent unto them, which his abiding ſo long in the grave was, but not his abiding ſo long either in Limb, or in the hell of the damned. For if ever Chriſt were there, yet it was more then the Jews could ſee, but they might ſee that at ſuch a time he was laid in the grave, and that he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there untill ſuch a time after.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this hindreth not why it might not be within the earth; and that it was ſo, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſheweth, relating how a great ſtone was rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the mouth of the ſepulcher, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 60. and that <hi>John</hi> ſtooped down to look into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 5.

            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Again they argue from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 9. where it is ſaid, That Chriſt <hi>deſcended into the lower parts of the earth,</hi> which ſome will have to ſignifie hell, the place of torment, and the Papiſts will have <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> to be meant.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:111827:111"/> ſhould denote the hell of the damned, or <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> (if there had been any ſuch place at all) I do not ſee, it being unknown to us [as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore] where that hell is ſeated. 2.

            </p>
            <p>Before Chriſt could aſcend into heaven, it was neceſſary that he ſhould deſcend to the earth by his Incarnation; but there was no neceſſity of his deſcending either to the hell of the damned, or to <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> before his Aſcenſion into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: he might well aſcend thither, though he did never deſcend to either of thoſe places. 3.

The grave is called the lower parts of the earth (that is, one of the lower parts, as <hi>Iudg.</hi> 12. 7. it's ſaid, <hi>Iephtah</hi> was buried in the Cities of <hi>Gilead,</hi> that is, in one of the Cities) in oppoſition to the ſurface on upper part of the earth, on which we live.

            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But againſt this expoſition it is objected, that in the Creed Chriſts buriall is ſpoken of before, and that plainly, and therefore it is not probable that it ſhould be mentioned over again, and that in ſuch obſcure words as theſe, <hi>he deſcended into hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This objection ſeems to be of much force, and in this reſpect I am inclined to think, that the meaning of theſe words, <hi>he deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell,</hi> is not the ſame with that which went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before, <hi>and buried,</hi> but that ſomething
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:111827:116"/> more is ſignified in Chriſts deſcending into hell, then in his buriall; yet they that follow this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition do not altogether want what to anſwer to the Objection. For, 1. When as anciently (as before I noted) only one of theſe (either Chriſts buriall or his deſcending into hell) was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Creed, it might ſo come to paſſe, that afterward both were joyned together, and yet the ſame thing be ſignified by them. 2. Chriſts funeration or preparing for his bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be underſtood in the Creed by the word<note place="margin">See. B. Uſher.</note>

The words in the Originall, which are rendred, <hi>for my buriall,</hi> properly ſignifie, <hi>to prepare me for buriall.</hi> And by Chriſts deſcending into hell, may be meant his interring, or laying in the grave. 3. If theſe anſwers do not ſatisfie, as I confeſſe I am not ſatisfied with them, it may be ſaid, (and ſo ſome do interpret their meaning) that they who expound thoſe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ameſ. in Bel. Ener.</note> 
               <hi>ſoul in hell,</hi> ſo as by hell to underſtand the grave, do not by Chriſts being in hell, or deſcending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell ſimply underſtand his be laid in the grave, [which is his buriall] but his abiding in the ſtate of death, which in reſpect of the body, was his abiding in the grave: But this laſt anſwer falls into another Expoſition of Chriſts deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into hell, which though it be neare a-kin to this laſt mentioned, yet is diſtinct from it.<note place="margin">The fifth Opinion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, therefore ſome by Chriſts being in hell underſtand his being in the ſtate of the dead, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:111827:116"/> under the power and dominion of death. And this I hold the beſt and moſt genuine Expoſition of theſe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in hell,</hi> that is, thou wilt not leave me in the ſtate of the dead, or under the power of death, but wilt raiſe me againe from the dead. And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Article of Chriſts deſcending into hell (whereof theſe words are the foundation) imports no more, but that Chriſt went into the other world, was in the ſtate of the dead, and under deaths dominion, to wit, untill his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. This Expoſition keeps the propriety of the words, and the order of the Creed, neither is there any thing that I know of weight againſt it. The Hebrew word <hi>Sheol,</hi> and the Greek <hi>Hades,</hi> which are rendred ſometimes hell, do ſignifie the eſtate of the dead, or the power of death; <hi>Hell and deſtruction are before the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15. 11. <hi>Janſenius</hi> a learned Writer of the Church of Rome, upon the place notes, that by hell and deſtruction<note place="margin">Per infernum &amp; perditionem ſignificatur ſtatus mortuorum, &amp; non ſolum damnatorum, ut nos ferè ex his vocibus auditis concipimus, ſed in genere ſtatus defunctorum. <hi>Janſen. ad loc.</hi>
               </note> is ſignified the ſtate of the dead, and not onely of the damned, as we uſually when we hear theſe words, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but the ſtate of thoſe in generall that are departed out of this life. Thus alſo <hi>Genebrard</hi> another Romiſh Author, and a skilfull Hebritian, on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 3. (as we reckon)<note place="margin">Ab infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, id eſt, è ſtatu mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum liberaſti. <hi>Geneb. ad loc.</hi>
               </note> where <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>O Lord thou haſt brought up my ſoul from Sheol,</hi> (hell, our Tranſlators have, <hi>the grave) Genebrard</hi> I ſay interprets it thus: <hi>From hell, that is, out of the ſtate of the dead haſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:111827:117"/> me.</hi> And ſo that <hi>Pſal. 89. 48. What man is he that liveth and ſhall not ſee death? and ſhall he deliver his ſoul from the hand of Sheol, of hell?</hi> So <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> That in the Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer. <hi>Infernus ſignificat totum mortuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Gen. ad loc.</note> one of our Tranſlations hath it, the laſt Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath <hi>of the grave;</hi> that likewiſe doth <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brard</hi> expound in like manner, though firſt he would draw it to their fained <hi>Limbus</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, yet upon ſecond thoughts (which uſe to be wiſer) he addes, <hi>Hell doth ſignifie the whole ſtate of the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is evident, that by hell there, cannot be meant the hell of the damned; for <hi>David</hi> would not make it a thing impoſſible for any to eſcape that hell, as he doth make it for any to eſcape the hell that he ſpeaketh of: Therefore by <hi>hell</hi> he muſt needs mean either the grave (and then the word [ſoul] is not taken properly) or the ſtate of the ſtate of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dead, from which without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diſpenſation, none is exempted. Thus alſo is the Greek word <hi>Hades</hi> uſed, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55. O Hades, [O hell,</hi> ſo our Tranſlators in the Margent render it, though the Textuall reading be, <hi>O grave] where is thy victory?</hi> There is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hell, but the ſtate of the dead, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, which is vanquiſhed and deſtroyed at and by the Reſurrection, of which the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh. So <hi>Rev. 20. 16. Death and hell were caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> that is, death and the power of death: For the hell of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the place of torment, cannot there be meant by <hi>hell,</hi> that hell being <hi>the lake of fire,</hi> into which hell, there ſpoken of, is caſt: The meaning of the words is, that at the Reſurrection there
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:111827:117"/> ſhall be no more death, nor any power of death any where, but only in that lake of fire, the place where the damned are in torment, whoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becauſe of the wretchedneſſe of it, is called death, <hi>the ſecond death,</hi> Rev. 20. 6. And thus both Eccleſiaſticall and Heathen Authors do uſe the word <hi>Hades,</hi> making all that are dead, and ſo under the power of death, to be <gap reason="foreign">

S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> words alſo do confirm this Expoſition, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 24. where ſpeaking of Chriſt he ſaith, <hi>Whom God hath raiſed up, having looſed the pains of death, becauſe it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden by it.</hi> The word in the Originall ſignifies <hi>to</hi> be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> by force and ſtrong hand, to be holden under ones power and dominion. And to prove that Chriſt could not poſſibly be thus held by death, he alledgeth the teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who ſpeaking in the Perſon of Chriſt, ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell:</hi> So that by <hi>Peters</hi> Commentary upon theſe words of <hi>David,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:111827:118"/> that Chriſts not being left in hell ſignifies nothing els but his not being left under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, from which he was freed by his Reſurrection, of which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith that <hi>David</hi> did ſpeak in thoſe words, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 31. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Chriſts being in hell (which is implied in theſe words of <hi>David, Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell,</hi> and expreſſed in the Creed) imports nothing els but his being under the power of death, under which he was kept for a while, though not long. So that of S. <hi>Paul, Rom. 6. 9. Christ being riſen from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him;</hi> that alſo intimates that Chriſt being dead, untill he roſe from the dead, death had dominion over him, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would or no, but through his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But may ſome ſay, according to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, there is nothing more ſignified in the Article of Chriſts deſcending into hell, then in the other that he died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: Yes, there is more ſignified in the one, then in the other: For that Chriſt died, imports only that his ſoul was ſeparated from his bodie; but, that he deſcended into hell, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that his ſoule and bodie continued for a while in the ſtate of ſeparation, to wit, untill his Reſurrection, when they were again united one to the other. Such difference as there is betwixt<note place="margin">B. Uſher.</note> birth and life here, ſuch alſo is there betwixt death and deſcending into hell: Death performs its work in a moment, but hell continues this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:111827:118"/> work, to wit, the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, untill the body riſing again, the ſoule and it are reunited together: Therefore it may ſeem to be ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8. that <hi>hell followed after death,</hi> and thus both ſoul and body are ſaid to be in <hi>Sheol,</hi> or <hi>Hades,</hi> or <hi>hell,</hi> whileſt they remaine ſeparated one from the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But again it may be objected, that if the ſoul whileſt it is in a ſtate of ſeparation from the body, be ſaid to be in hell, then it is in hell even when it is in heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is granted; nor is this uncouth or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, as ſome may think it to be, becauſe of the uſuall ſenſe and ſignification wherein the word <hi>hell</hi> is taken: For as the word <hi>fleſh</hi> is in<note place="margin">B. Uſher.</note> our ordinary ſpeech taken ſtrictly in oppoſition to <hi>fiſh,</hi> yet ſometimes, and in propriety of ſpeech it is of a more large extent. For, <hi>there is a fleſh of fiſh,</hi> 1 Cor, 15. 39. So though we uſually take the word <hi>hell</hi> in oppoſition to heaven, taking hell for the place of torment, as heaven for the place of happineſſe; yet the word <hi>hell</hi> as anſwering the Hebrew <hi>Sheol,</hi> and the Greek <hi>Hades,</hi> is ſo large as to comprehend even heaven it ſelf in the notion of it: Not indeed as heaven is the place of bliſſe and happineſſe, nor as it ſhall be after the Reſurrection, when the ſoul and body ſhall be in heaven, but as heaven is the receptacle of ſouls ſeparated from their bodies; which ſtate of ſeparation (though it rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h to heaven, as it doth in reſpect of the ſouls of the godly, yet)
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:111827:119"/> appertains to the dominion of death, and the imperfection of the Saints, who are not ſet free from that dominion of death, and that imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, untill the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Some may yet again object, That the word <hi>deſcended,</hi> which is uſed in the Creed, argues that <hi>hell</hi> is below, whereas heaven is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: and how then can it be ſaid, that Chriſt (in reſpect of his ſoul) deſcended into hell, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his ſoul went to heaven?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this it is anſwered divers wayes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That although when the godly die, in reſpect of<note place="margin">Licet ex mortuis aliqui aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendunt in coelum, omnes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, qui ſepeliuntur, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt in terram; unde à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione prima deſcenſus cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verum, totus reliquus mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum ſtatus appellatur deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. <hi>Alſted. in Theol.

               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:111827:120"/> told the Diſciples, that one was to be choſen in the place of <hi>Judas</hi> the traitour; and why? to be a <hi>witneſſe with us</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>of his</hi> (that is, of Chriſts) <hi>reſurrection,</hi> Act. 1. 22. The Apoſtles were to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie other things beſides the reſurrection of Chriſt, but this is mentioned as a principall point to which they were to give teſtimony. So Act. 4. 33. <hi>And with great power gave the Apoſtles witneſſe of the reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The Jews, the profeſſed enemies of Chriſt, believe that he died, even died the death of the Croſſe; but they will not believe that he roſe again, therefore Chriſt<note place="margin">Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti eſt fides Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum.</note> crucified is a ſtumbling block unto them, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. But Chriſts reſurrection is the faith of a Chriſtian. He that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, doth believe nothing to any purpoſe, <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and he is as not riſen, to thoſe that do not believe him to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen) <hi>then is our preaching vain, and your faith alſo is vain,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 14. And again v. 17. <hi>If Chriſt be not raiſed your faith is vain.</hi> It behoves every one therefore, not only to ſay that he believeth the article of Chriſts reſurrection, but to believe it indeed, and to know upon what grounds he doth believe it. Let us therefore ſee what grounds we have for this in, and from the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſts reſurrection was tipified and prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured. Some conceive <hi>Iſaac</hi> to have been a type and figure of Chriſt in this reſpect; <hi>Iſaac,</hi> I ſay, who (as the ſtory ſhews, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.) was bound, and laid upon the Altar, and as good as dead, yet was raiſed up and delivered: whence it is ſaid, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> received him from the dead <hi>in a figure,</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:111827:121"/> Heb. 11. 19. Some underſtand it thus in a figure of<note place="margin">

That <hi>Ionas</hi> his deliverance out of the whales bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherein he was (as it were) buried, was a type of Chriſts reſurrection from the dead, we have Chriſts own teſtimony. <hi>As</hi> Jonas <hi>was three daies, and three nights in the whales belly</hi> (and then was delivered out of it) <hi>ſo ſhall the ſon of man be three daies, and three nights in the heart of the earth,</hi> that is, in the grave, and then be raiſed up out of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 40.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſts reſurrection was prophecied and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told: Chriſt himſelf the great Prophet did foretel it in thoſe words even now cited. And ſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, Mat. 17, 22, 23. <hi>The ſon of man ſhall be betrayed into the hands of men; and they ſhall kil him, and the third day he ſhall be raiſed again.</hi> And Joh. 2. 19. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto them; deſtroy this Temple, and in three daies I will raiſe it up.</hi> This he ſpake of the Temple of his body, as it follows there v. 22. And when he was riſen from the dead, his Diſciples remembred that he had ſaid this unto them, v. 22. Although Chriſts owne Diſciples (it ſeems) did not underſtand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe words untill they were fulfilled, that is, untill Chriſt was riſen from the dead, yet Chriſt had ſo plainly at other times foretold his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that the chief Prieſts and Phariſees could ſay unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> when Chriſt was crucified, dead and buried, <hi>Sir, we remember that that deceiver ſaid, while he was yet alive, after three daies I will riſe again.</hi> And ſo the Prophets that were before
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:111827:121"/> Chriſts coming in the fleſh, did foreſhew (as other things concerning him) that he ſhould riſe from the dead. <hi>David</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell, nor ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> Pſal. 16. 10. did ſpeak of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as is teſtified by S. <hi>Peter</hi> Act. 2. 31. <hi>He ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this before, ſpake of the reſurrection of Christ, that his ſoul was not left in hell, nor his fleſh did ſee corruption.</hi> And ſo by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 13. 35, 36, 37. Wherefore he ſaith alſo in another Pſalm, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption. For</hi> David <hi>after he had ſerved his own generation by the will of God, fell aſleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and ſaw corruption. But he whom God raiſed again, ſaw no corruption.</hi> So all the Prophets ſpeaking of Chriſt, his Prieſthood, and Kingdome induring for ever, did conſequently ſpeak of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. As <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> who by the title ſeems to have been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of that. 72. Pſalme.</note>

               </gap>. 34. But the Prophets had no ſuch meaning, but that though Chriſt did die, yet he ſhould riſe againe and ſo abide for ever. And therefore Chriſt called them <hi>fools, and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets had written,</hi> who would not believe his reſurrection, when they were told of it, Luk. 24. 25. And <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſed that he did <hi>ſay no other things, then thoſe which the Prophets and</hi> Moſes <hi>did ſay ſhould come, That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and that he ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead,</hi> Act. 26. 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All the foure Evangeliſts (as we call them)
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:111827:122"/> 
               <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> have carefully recorded Chriſts riſing from the dead. Though as in other of their relations, ſo in this, they differ in circumſtances, ſome relating one cireumſtance, ſome another, yet they agree in the ſubſtance, all relating this, that he roſe again. They ſhew us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that Chriſt after his reſurrection by many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proofs did ſhew himſelf alive, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, Act. 1. 3. That when his Diſciples thought him to have been a ſpirit, he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf, handle me, and ſee, for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have. And when he had thus ſpoken, he ſhewed them his hands and his feet,</hi> Luk. 24. 39, 40. And preſently after it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that he called for meat, and did eat before them. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo relates how when Chriſt had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared after his reſurrection to the Apoſtles, <hi>Thomas</hi> not being among them when he heard of it, he would not believe it, profeſſing that except he ſhould ſee in his hands the print of the nails, and put his finger into the print of his nails, and thruſt his hand into his ſide, he would not believe. And that afterward Chriſt appeared unto them again, <hi>Thomas</hi> being with them, and that he ſpake unto <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaying, <hi>Reach hither thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide, and be not faithleſſe, but believe:</hi> And that then <hi>Thomas</hi> cried out, <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> Joh. 20. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts alſo record that Chriſts reſurrection was witneſſed by an Angel from heaven, <hi>Mat. 28. 5, 6. Mar.</hi> 16. 5, 6. Yea by more Angels then one, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:111827:122"/>4. The Apoſtles did no leſſe diligently preach and publiſh Chriſts reſurrection. <hi>Paul</hi> preached it, as he teſtifieth, 1 Cor. 15. 4. Where alſo in the verſes following he doth largely inſiſt upon the proof and demonſtration of it. So <hi>Act</hi> 13. 30. &amp;c. We find that in one of his Sermons he was much upon this point. And ſo alſo was <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2. 24. &amp;c. And it is ſaid of all the Apoſtles in generall (except <hi>Paul</hi> who was called to the Apoſtleſhip afterward) <hi>that with great power they gave wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Act. 4. 33. And <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth the force of this argument drawn from the preaching of the Apoſtles, <hi>Yea, and we are found falſe witneſſes of God, becauſe we have testified of God, that he raiſed up Chriſt, whom he raiſed not up, if ſo be that the dead riſe not,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Divers reaſons and arguments grounded upon Scripture prove that Chriſt did riſe from the dead. For 1. It was meet that as Chriſt did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and voluntarily humble himſelf, ſo again he ſhould be exalted, <hi>Thoſe that honour me, I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> ſaith God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. Therefore as Chriſt did honour God by ſubmitting himſelf unto death, ſo God would honour him by raiſing him from the dead. <hi>He humbled himſelf, &amp; became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo hath highly exalted him,</hi> Phil. 2. 8. 9.<note place="margin">Manſit &amp; in ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parabilis unitas. Bern. de Conſid. l. 5. c. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. Although when Chriſt died, his ſoul and body were ſeparated one from the other, yet the divine nature was ſeparated from neither the one nor the other. <hi>Come, ſee the place where the Lord lay,</hi> ſaid the Angel, ſpeaking of the grave where
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:111827:123"/> the dead body of Chriſt was laid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 6. which ſhews that the divine nature was ſtill united to the body, though the ſoul were ſeparated from it. And otherwiſe we could not rightly confeſſe (as we do) in the Creed, that Chriſt the only ſon of God was buried. Now there being this union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the divine nature, and Chriſts body, it was not only meet, but neceſſary that his body ſhould be raiſed up, and not be held under deaths domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Though being man he died, yet being God he roſe again; <hi>being put to death in the fleſh,</hi> (his humane nature) <hi>but quickned by the ſpirit,</hi> his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>3. For the working out of our redemption it was requiſite that Chriſt ſhould not only die, but alſo riſe again. Some when Chriſt did hang upon the Croſſe, blaſphemed, ſaying, <hi>He ſaved others, himſelfe he cannot ſave,</hi> Mar. 15. 31. Whereas that he might ſave others, himſelf he would not ſave, <hi>viz.</hi> not ſo as not to die. But had he ſo died, as not to riſe again, his death would have been of none effect. For how could we have believed, that he by his death had redeemed us from death (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eternall death and deſtruction) if he himſelf had been ſo ſwallowed up of death, as for ever to lie under the power and dominion of it? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith that Chriſt <hi>was delivered for our offences, and roſe again for our justification,</hi> Rom. 4. 25. And, <hi>if Chriſt be not riſen, your faith is in vain, you are yet in your ſins,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 17. And as Chriſts reſurrection was thus neceſſary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our <hi>redemption, the forgiveneſſe of our ſins;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 7. Rom. 8. 23.</note> ſo was it alſo in reſpect of the <hi>redemption of our
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:111827:123"/> body.</hi> How could we have expected the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our bodies, if Chriſts body had not been raiſed up? If the Head had not riſen again, how ſhould the members riſe again? The reſurrection of the members depends upon the reſurrection of the Head; the reſurrection of Chriſtians upon Chriſts reſurrection, as the Apoſtle ſhews at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. Now if Chriſt roſe again; then how wretched and miſerable are the Jews, who wil not believe Chriſts reſurrection, but as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, ſo do they ſtill, impugne and oppoſe it. S. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates that when the ſouldiers that were ſet to guard Chriſts ſepulcher, went and told the chief Prieſts what had happened they gave them large money that they might ſay, that whiles they ſlept, Chriſts Diſciples came and ſtole them away, <hi>And this ſaying,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is commonly reported among the Iews untill this day,</hi> Mat. 28. 11. 15. Now conſider a little what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and fooliſh fable this was, which yet the Jews were ſo ready to believe. 1. How improbable that a few weak timorous men, who but a few daies before did forſake, yea one of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear Chriſt, yet now ſhould be ſo valiant, or rather fool-hardy, as to adventure to ſteal Chriſt out of the grave, knowing that a guard of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was purpoſely ſet to prevent ſuch a deſigne? 2. Suppoſe they ſhould have ſo far adventured, as ſome of them to eſpie whether the ſouldiers were aſleep or no, yet how could they aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the ſouldiers ſhould continue aſleep,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:111827:124"/> untill they had diſpatched that for which they came? Yea, how could this be, there being a great ſtone for them to roll away from the mouth of the ſepulcher, which could not be done without making ſuch a noiſe as to awaken ſome of the ſouldiers at leaſt, if they were aſleep before? 3. Grant the Diſciples ſhould have had ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as to attempt the buſineſſe, and ſuch happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as to effect it, yet would they have been ſo fooliſh and unwiſe, as to ſtay at the ſepulcher to unlooſe the cloaths in which Chriſts body was wrapped? Would they not rather have haſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the body as it was buried, and have loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the cloths then when they had more leiſure to do it, and might do it with more ſafety? But the linnen cloths were found lying in the grave, and the napkin that was about Chriſts head, not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the linnen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by it ſelf, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 6. 7. And 4. if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples could break thorough all difficulties, and get Chriſts body away with them, yet could they put life into it when they had it? But Chriſt <hi>after his paſſion, by many infallible proofs ſhewed himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,</hi> Act. 1. 3. otherwiſe it is ſenſleſſe to imagine, that the Diſciples (having ſo deſerted Chriſt, when he was alive) would have ſo conſtantly preached and avouched his reſurrection, as they did. And laſtly, the very tale doth ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it ſelf, and ſhew its own abſurdity. For if the ſouldiers (as they ſaid) were aſleep, how then could they tell that Chriſt was taken away by his Diſciples? it might be otherwiſe (as indeed it
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:111827:124"/> was) for any thing thar they did know.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly, Chriſts reſurrection ſerves to demonſtrate Chriſts divinity. The divinity of Chriſt and his reſurrection, ſo mutually help to demonſtrate each other. His reſurrection is demonſtrated by his divinity, as the effect by the cauſe: and his divinity by his refurrection, as the cauſe by the effect. That which God the Father ſpeaks unto Chriſt, Pſal. 2. 7. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to Chriſts reſurrection, Act. 13. 32. 33. <hi>And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled the ſame unto us, in that he hath raiſed up Ieſus again, as it is alſo written in the ſecond Pſalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> The Apoſtle by this day, ſhews that the day of Chriſts reſurrection is underſtood; not that then Chriſt was firſt begotten of the Father, and became the Son of God (for he was ſo from all eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 2.) but then when Chriſt roſe again he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be the Son of God, his begotten Son, God of God, one and the ſame God with the Pather. Thus the ſame Apoſtle ſaith plainly, that Chriſt <hi>was declared to be the Son of God, with power, according to the ſpirit of holineſſe, by the reſurrection from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. Chriſts divine nature before did lie hid under the infirmity of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, but by his riſing from the dead it did look forth, and ſhew it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some may ſay, many others (as we find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded both in the old, and in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:111827:125"/> did riſe from the dead beſides Chriſt, yea many before Chriſt, and how then doth his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection demonſtrate his divine nature?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Chriſts reſurrection did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the refunction of others in a twofold reſpect. For 1. Others did riſe again, but ſo as to die again the life to which they roſe was this mortall life, But Chriſt aroſe to life immortall; <hi>Chriſt being. riſen from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him,</hi> Rom. 6.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſt aroſe by his own vertue and power, which none ever did, or ſhall do, but he only. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this Temple</hi> (ſaid Chriſt, meaning his body) <hi>and in three daies I will raiſe it up,</hi> Joh. 2. 19. <hi>I lay down my life</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I may take it up again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again,</hi> Joh. 10. 17. 18. Now except Chriſt were God, it had not<note place="margin">Reſurrexiſſe per ſe ex mortuis in vitam, niſi Dei natura non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit. <hi>Hilar.</hi> de <hi>Trin. l. 7.</hi>
               </note> been poſſible for him to raiſe himſelf from the dead, this is not competible to a meer humane nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But may ſome object, it is ſaid in the Text, and in other places, that God raiſed up Chriſt; therefore [it ſeems] he did not raiſe himſelf, but was raiſed by another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth not follow; Chriſt both was raiſed of God, and alſo did raiſe himſelf. As man, ſo God did raiſe him up; as God; ſo he roſe of himſelf; Chriſt and the Father are one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 30. That which the Father doth, he doth alſo,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:111827:125"/> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 17. &amp; 14. 10, 11. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Cum eadem fit divina virtus &amp; operatio, &amp; Patris, &amp; Filii, haec duo ſe mutuò conſequuntur, quòd Chriſtus fit ſuſcitatus divinâ virtute Patris &amp;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſui ipſius. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. part. 3. queſt. 53. art. 4. ad. 1.</note> theſe two are ſo farre from croſſing one the other.

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Thirdly, by Chriſts Reſurrection our faith is confirmed in him as a moſt perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: For ſeeing that Chriſt died for our ſins, he as our Surety, was arreſted by death as Gods Serjeant, and caſt into the priſon of the grave, in that he was not ſtill detained there, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed and ſet free, it clearly ſhewes that the debt is diſcharged, Gods juſtice ſatisfied, and we through faith in Chriſt, reconciled unto God, and at peace with him. The two Diſciples that knew Chriſt to be dead, but knew not that he was riſen again, ſeemed to have but ſmall hope of redemption by him, <hi>We trusted</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>that it had been he that ſhould have redeemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſrael,</hi> Luk. 24. 21. They did truſt ſo before, but now (it ſeems) they did in a manner deſpair of it: And indeed had Chriſt ſo died as not to riſe againe, we could have had but a dead hope, as I ſhewed before. But now our hope is <hi>a lively hope,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it; <hi>Bleſſed be God, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who according to his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope.</hi> (how?) <hi>by the reſurrection of Jeſus Christ from the dead,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> having ſaid that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:111827:126"/> Chriſt <hi>was delivered for our offences, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for our juſtification,</hi> he addes immediately, <hi>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through Jeſus Christ our Lord,</hi> Rom. 4. 25. &amp; 5. 1. And <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38, 39. having imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before confirmed Chriſts Reſurrection, he thereupon inferres, <hi>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that thorough this man is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you forgiveneſſe of ſins: And by him all that believe are juſtified, &amp;c.</hi> And Rom. 8. 34. he cryeth out, <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea, rather that is riſen again.</hi> And Heb. 7. 25. <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave to the uttermost all that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to make interceſſion for them.</hi>

Fourthly, by the Reſurrection of Chriſt we may be aſſured of our owne Reſurrection: The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. to convince ſome among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who denied the Reſurrection of the dead, firſt proves at large Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from thence inferreth the reſurrection of Chriſtians: <hi>Now if Chriſt be preached</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you, that there is no reſurrection of the dead? But if there be no reſurrection of the dead, then is Chriſt not riſen,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 12, 13. And v. 16. <hi>For if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed.</hi> And v. 20. &amp;c. <hi>But now is Christ riſen from the dead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the first fruits of them that ſlept: For ſince by man came death, by man alſo came the Reſurrection from the dead. For as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. But every man in his own order, Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterward they that are
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:111827:126"/> Chriſts at his coming.</hi> So 2 Cor. 4. 14. <hi>Knowing that he which raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe up us alſo by Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> And 1 Theſ. 4. 14. <hi>For if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The force of this inference (viz. of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſtians from Chriſts reſurrection) conſiſts in that near relation and union that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and Chriſtians, he being their head,<note place="margin">Quod prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſit in caepite, impletum erit in corpore. <hi>Bern.</hi>

For the members muſt be with the head, and conformed to it; <hi>Father I will that they whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, Joh. 17. 24. <hi>We know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like unto him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2. <hi>Christ ſhall change our vile bodies, and ſhall make them like unto his own most glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> Phil. 3. 21.</p>

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 5. FIftly and laſtly, as Chriſt roſe corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, ſo ought we to riſe ſpiritually, <hi>viz.</hi> from the death of ſin, to the life of grace. There is a death of the ſoul by ſin, and a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſoul by grace. <hi>Awake thou that ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 14. And that we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto Chriſt by a ſpirituall reſurrection, the Apoſtle ſheweth Rom. 6. 4. <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by baptiſme into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſſe of life,</hi> And v. 11. <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God thorough Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> We muſt thus be conformed unto Chriſt by the reſurrection of our ſouls here, or els we ſhall not be conformed unto Chriſt by the reſurrection of our bodies hereafter. For though all ſhall corporally riſe again, yet not ſo as to be conformed unto Chriſt in glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. No, thus ſhall none riſe corporally, but only ſuch as now riſe ſpiritually, ſo as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto Chriſt in grace and holineſſe. Only they that whiles they are upon earth, have their
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:111827:127"/> converſation in heaven, can expect that the Lord Jeſus will change their vile bodies, and make them like unto his own moſt glorious body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Now if we would know whether we be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of this ſpirituall reſurrection, we may try and diſcern it by theſe marks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Heavenly mindedneſſe. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things that are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the earth,</hi> Col. 3. 1. 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Love of Gods children. <hi>We know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. This is meant of loving the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> in that very reſpect as they are godly, not for by ends, or carnall reſpects, which they may do who are not godly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſenſe and feeling of ſpirituall wants and infirmities. VVhere there is ſuch a feeling there is life, as there was in <hi>Paul,</hi> who complained of the corruptions that were in him, as grievous and burthenſome unto him; <hi>For I know</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that in me (that is in my fleſh) no good dwelleth. For to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For the good that I would do, I do not, but the evill that I would not, that I do. I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me. For I delight in the law of God, after the inward man; But I ſee another law in my members warring againſt the law of my mind, and leading me captive to the law of ſin, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death,</hi> Rom. 7. 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:111827:128"/> On the other ſide, ſuch appears to be <hi>alienated from the life of God,</hi> as are <hi>without feeling,</hi> Eph. 4. 18, 19. ſuch as are full of ſin and of corruption, and yet are nothing ſenſible of it, but like the Angell of the Church of Laodicea, think that they are rich and increaſed with goods, and have need of nothing, when as indeed they are wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A love of Gods Ordinances: As they that have corporall life, ſo alſo they that have ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, will deſire food convenient for them, whereby their life may be preſerved, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may grow: <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that you may grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; If ſo be that you have taſted, that the Lord is gracious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Pet. 2. 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Communion with God by prayer. The Spirit which is the worker of this ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, is the <hi>Spirit of grace and ſupplications,</hi> Zach. 12. 10. <hi>The Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. <hi>Behold he prayeth,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Ananias,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Saul</hi> (after called <hi>Paul</hi>) when a ſpirituall life was newly put into him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11.</p>
            <p>The ordinary means whereby this ſpirituall reſurrection is wrought, is the Word preached: As at the laſt day, <hi>the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead</hi> (corporally) <hi>ſhall be raiſed,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 52. So they that are ſpiritually dead, are raiſed by the Trumpet of Gods Word, ſounding in their ears: <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that the houre is coming, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w is, that the dead
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:111827:128"/> ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live,</hi> Joh. 5. 25. That is ſpoken of the ſpirituall Reſurrection, as appears by theſe words, <hi>and now is,</hi> even as that which preſently after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, v. 28. &amp; 29. is ſpoken of the corporall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; <hi>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the corporall Reſurrection and the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall in this do differ, that the corporall Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is compleat and perfect at once; <hi>In a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinkling of an eye,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 52. But the ſpirituall reſurrection is carried on by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by little and little, <hi>the inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 16. Therefore they that are already in ſome meaſure made partakers of ſpirituall reſurrection, muſt ſtill labour that they may be made more and more partakers of it; <hi>Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. So much for this point concerning Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>That Christ did riſe again from the dead.</hi> I come now to ſpeak a little of the time of his Reſurrection, <hi>the third day,</hi> and here this point is to be conſidered, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> That Chriſt did riſe again the third day. So we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in the Creed, &amp; the Scripture is clear &amp; expreſs for it: Chriſt fore-telling his reſurrection, did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fore-tell this circumſtance of time when it ſhould be; <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and after three dayes I will raiſe it up,</hi> Joh. 2. 19. <hi>From that time farth began Jeſus to ſhew unto his Diſciples, how that he muſt go unto Jeruſalem, and ſuffer many things of the Elders, and chief Prieſts and Scribes, and be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:111827:129"/> killed, and be raiſed again the third day,</hi> Mat. 16. 21. So Mat. 20. 18, 19. <hi>Behold, we go up to Jeruſalem, and the Son of Man ſhall be betrayed unto the chief Prieſts, and unto the Scribes, and they ſhall condemn him to death; And ſhall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to ſcourge, and crucifie him, and the third day he ſhall riſe again:</hi> And ſo much the chief Prieſts and Phariſees had underſtood, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their words to <hi>Pilate, Sir, we remember that that deceiver ſaid, while he was yet alive, after three dayes I will riſe again.</hi> And therefore they deſired to have Chriſts Sepulchre watched but <hi>till the third day,</hi> Mat. 27. 63, 64.</p>
            <p>All the four Evangeliſts alſo do record, as that Chriſt roſe again, ſo that he roſe again the third day.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>how that Chriſt did for our ſins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he roſe again the third day,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>It was congruous and meet that Chriſt ſhould riſe again the third day, not ſooner nor later. Not ſooner, to ſhew that he was truly dead, and for a while under the power of death, and the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which is meant by his being in hell, as was ſhevved before. Not later, that ſo he might comfort and revive the drooping and dying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Diſciples, who after his death, untill they heard of his reſurrection <hi>mourned and wept,</hi> Mar. 16. 10. And that he might ſtrengthen their faith which was ready to fail, as appears by that Luk. 24. 21. <hi>We truſted that it had been he, that ſhould have redeemed</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <pb n="249" facs="tcp:111827:129"/>
            <p>Again, it was not only congruous and meet, but alſo requiſite and neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould riſe the third day, becauſe ſo it was 1. prefigured; viz. by that which happened unto <hi>Ionas;</hi> his being three daies and three nights in the fiſhes belly, neither more nor leſſe, ſignified that Chriſt ſhould be ſo long, neither more nor leſſe in the grave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 40.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If Chriſt were three daies and three nights in the grave, how then did he riſe again the third day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe three daies, and three nights are taken ſynecdochically, that is, not for three whole daies, and three whole nights, but for part of three daies, and part of three nights. Chriſt died and was buried (as the Evangeliſts ſhew) the day before the Jewiſh Sabbath, that is on Friday (as we call it) towards evening; that part of the day is [by a ſynedoche] reckoned for a day, and to it belongs the night going before, the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the naturall day, which conſiſts of 24. hours, at evening, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 32. Then Chriſt lay in the grave the night following, and the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which we call Saturday, here are two daies and two nights, and ſo likewiſe he remained in the grave the night after, and roſe early in the morning, to which night muſt be added the day following, which we call Sunday, as being a part of that naturall day to which it belonged; and ſo there are three daies and three nights, and yet Chriſt roſe the third day. Thus are thoſe three daies and three nights to be underſtood, that Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her and the Jews faſted <hi>Esth.</hi> 4. 16. For the faſt
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:111827:130"/> ended the third day, as is clear by this, that then <hi>Eſther</hi> put on her royall apparell, and went to the King, &amp;c. <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. It was requiſite and neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould riſe again the third day, becauſe it was ſo prophecied, <hi>Thus it is written</hi> [ſaid Chriſt to his Diſciples after his reſurrection) <hi>and thus it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day,</hi> Luk. 24. 46. So <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith that Chriſt <hi>roſe again the third day according to the Scriptures,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But (may ſome ſay) where in the Old Teſtament is it prophecied that Chriſt ſhould riſe the third day?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Thoſe words of <hi>David,</hi> which he ſpake of Chriſt, and of his reſurrection, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> Pſal. 16. 10. though they do not preciſely mention the third day, yet they plainly ſhew ſo much, that he ſhould not remain long in the grave, but ſhould ſpeedily riſe again. And by this S. <hi>Paul</hi> proves that the words were not meant of <hi>David</hi> himſelf, but of Chriſt; for that <hi>David</hi> ſaw corruption, but Chriſt (being raiſed from the dead the third day) ſaw no corruption, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 35, 36, 37. In the like manner did <hi>S. Peter</hi> argue, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 29. 30, 31, 32.</p>

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. There is expreſſe mention of the third day in reference to Chriſts Reſurrection, Hoſ. 6. 2. <hi>Aſter two daies he will revive us, in the third day he will raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight.</hi> Although thoſe words be directly and immediately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Gods people (as it ſeems both by the words themſelves, and alſo by the words going

Neither do I know, how it could be ſaid that Chriſt roſe again the third, according to the Scriptures (viz. of the old Teſtament) if in this place there be not an alluſion at leaſt to Chriſts riſing again the third day; ſeeing that in all the old Teſtament the third day in this reſpect is no where mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except in this place.

            <p>Now from the time of Chriſts Reſurrection, the third day after that he died, it is worthy to<note place="margin">Bern. Ser. 1. de reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</note> be obſerved (as <hi>Bernard</hi> hath noted) that the ſame

            </p>
            <p>Divers of the Evangeliſts do alſo record Chriſts aſcenſion: <hi>He was received up into heaven,</hi> Mar. 16. 19. <hi>He was parted from them, (viz.</hi> his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,) <hi>and was carried up into heaven,</hi> Luk. 24. 51. <hi>While they beheld he was taken up,</hi> Acts 1. 9.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Luke</hi> alſo relates the circumſtances of Chriſts aſcenſion: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The time when he aſcended, <hi>viz.</hi> forty daies
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:111827:133"/> after his reſurrection: <hi>To whom alſo he ſhewed himſelf alive after his paſſion by many infallible proofs, being ſeen of them forty dayes, and ſpeaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 1. 3. where he giveth two reaſons why Chriſt did continue ſo long upon earth after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before he aſcended into heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. To confirme unto his Diſciples his reſurrection, and to aſſure them of the truth of it. 2. To inſtruct them in things pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The place where, viz. Bethany: <hi>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 24. 50. Now Joh. 11. 1. it's ſaid that Bethany was the Town of <hi>Mary</hi> and her ſiſter <hi>Martha,</hi> that is, the towne where they dwelt, and had their abode; in which ſenſe Bethſaida is called the City of <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 1. 44. Yet it ſeems that the place where Chriſt aſcended, was not the town called Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but the Tract of Mount Olivet, where the Town ſtood. For it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 12. That the Diſciples who were with Chriſt at his aſcenſion, immediately after he was aſcended, <hi>returned unto Ieruſalem from the Mount called Olivet.</hi> It is not likely that Chriſt would be in a Town, when he aſcended; for then all promiſcuouſly would have ſeen his aſcenſion, whereas only his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were Spectators of it: Neither is it ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 50. that Chriſt led them to Bethanie, and there aſcended, but that <hi>he led them out [viz.</hi> from Jeruſalem] <hi>as farre as Bethanie. S. Luke</hi> ch. 19. v. 29. tells us, that as Chriſt went to his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he went by Bethanie; ſo that by the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:111827:133"/> ſame place by which he went to his Paſſion, he had his aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>And Bethany alſo ſignifies as much as the <hi>houſe of affliction;</hi> if we will aſcend up to our Fathers houſe to heaven, it muſt be by Bethany, the houſe of affliction: <hi>We muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 14. 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The manner how he aſcended; <hi>And it came to paſſe while he bleſſed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven,</hi> Luke 24. 51. <hi>Thus having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them to the end,</hi> Joh. 13. 1. At the very laſt moment of his abiding here upon earth, he bleſſed thoſe that were with him, and in them us, and all that belong unto him: As he ſaid <hi>Ioh. 17. 20. Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word;</hi> So neither did he bleſſe them alone, but them alſo which through their word believe in him. Again, for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſts aſcenſion, it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9. That <hi>while they</hi> (his Diſciples) <hi>beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight,</hi> So that Chriſt did aſcend viſibly, and there were eye-witneſſes of his aſcenſion: and leſt they ſhould have imagined, that their ſenſes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, or any way have doubted of the truth of Chriſts aſcenſion, two Angels from heaven in the likeneſſe of men appeared unto them, both to confirm Chriſts aſcenſion into heaven, and alſo to ſhew that he was not ſo aſcended, but that he ſhall at length come againe, <hi>viz.</hi> at the laſt judgement. <hi>And while they looked ſtedfaſtly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heaven, as he went up, behold two men ſtood
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:111827:134"/> by them in white apparell, which alſo ſaid, ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven? This ſame Jeſus, which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner, as ye have ſeen him go into heaven,</hi> Act. 1. 10. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some may here object that Joh. 3. 13. <hi>The Son of man, which is in heaven.</hi> If Chriſt then being upon earth, were in heaven, how could he aſcend into heaven?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, being in heaven (even when he was upon earth) as God, he might nevertheleſſe, and did as man aſcend into heaven. Chriſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of two natures, the divine, and the humane, ſomething belongs unto him in reſpect of the one nature, and ſomething in reſpect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In reſpect of his divine nature he is every where, in reſpect of his humane, he is onely in one place at one time. The man Chriſt, yet not as man, but as God, was in heaven at the ſame time that he was upon earth. On the other ſide, Chriſt being God, yet not as God, but as man, left the earth, and went up to heaven.</p>
            <p>There are many reaſons why Chriſt aſcended into heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As he came from heaven to work our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ſo having finiſhed the work which he<note place="margin">Reaſons of Chriſts Aſcenſion</note> had to do, it was meet that he ſhould return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from whence he came; <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world, and go to the Father,</hi> ſaid he, Joh. 16. 28. And Joh. 17. 4, 5. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do, and now, O Father, glorifie me with thine
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:111827:134"/> own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. After Chriſts humiliation, was to follow his exaltation, as Chriſt himſelf ſhewed, Luk. 24. 26. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> Phil. 2. 8, 9. Now as Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was the firſt ſtep of his exaltation, ſo his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion was another ſtep, and a further degree of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus Chriſt made it appear, that (as he told <hi>Pilate</hi>) his Kingdom is not of this world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 36. Contrary to what his own Diſciples did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, even after his reſurrection, as appears by that queſtion which they asked him, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> Act. 1. 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Chriſt by his aſcenſion ſhewed himſelf to have fully conquered ſin, death and Satan; he did manifeſt his victory over theſe by his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but more fully by his aſcenſion, whereby he did triumph over them: Therefore it is ſaid, that when <hi>he aſcended up on high, he led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 8. that is, he led a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of captives, as the phraſe is uſed, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It was requiſite that Chriſt ſhould aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, that as he executed the office of a Prieſt, by offering himſelf upon the Croſſe for us, ſo he might alſo do it by appearing before God in heaven, and there making interceſſion unto him for us. <hi>Aaron</hi> the Jewiſh high Prieſt was to bear the names of the children of Iſrael in the breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of judgement upon his heart, when he went into the holy place for a memoriall before the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:111827:135"/> Lord continually, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 29. This was a type and a figure of Chriſts entring into heaven for us as our high Prieſt, <hi>Whither the forerunner is for us entred, even Jeſus made an high Prieſt for ever, after the order of</hi> Melchiſedec, Heb. 6. 20. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelf now to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 24.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was to aſcend into heaven, that ſo he might powre his ſpirit upon his Church: <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 8. <hi>viz.</hi> ſpirituall gifts, the gifts and graces of his ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. it is ſaid that at his aſcenſion he <hi>received gifts,</hi> but <hi>for men,</hi> and that is as much as to give gifts unto men. <hi>Fetch me a little water,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eliah</hi> to the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, 1 Kings 17. 10. according to the originall it is, Receive, or take me (or for me) a little water;<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> and that is as much as if he had ſaid, Give me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle water: So v. 13. <hi>Bring me a morſell of bread;</hi> in the Hebrew, Receive, or take me, &amp;c. It is the ſame word which is uſed Pſal. 68. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may demand and ſay, Was not the ſpirit given unto men before Chriſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, yes, but not ſo freely and fully as afterwards: <hi>He that believeth on me</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water. This he ſpake</hi> (ſaith the Evangeliſt) <hi>of the ſpirit which they that believe on him ſhould receive. For the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe Jeſus was not yet glorified,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oh. 7. 38. 39. <hi>I tell you the truth,</hi> ſaid Chriſt
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:111827:135"/> to his Diſciples, <hi>it is not expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you,</hi> Joh. 16. 7. Beſides that, Chriſt was to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before that he was to ſend the Holy Ghoſt, the Diſciples having Chriſts corporall preſence, did ſo fix themſelves upon<note place="margin">Spiritalis preſentiae plenitudo, quamdiu conſpectu carnis praeſens aderat, adventare non poterat.

            <p>7. Chriſt aſcended into heaven, that he might there prepare a place for his members. Thus he told his Diſciples ſaying, <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many manſions, I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> Joh. 14. 2. In this reſpect Chriſt is called the <hi>fore-runner,</hi> Heb. 6. 20. as going before, and preparing the way for others to follow after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1, Now this point concerning Chriſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, ſerves t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> confute the Papiſts concerning Tranſubſtantiation, and that reall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament which they maintain, <hi>viz.</hi> a carnall and corporall preſence, for we deny not a reall preſence, onely we hold that is a ſpirituall preſence. And as the Angell argued from Chriſts Reſurrection, and thereby proved that he was not in the grave in that manner as ſome ſuppoſed; <hi>He is not here, for he is riſen,</hi> Mat 28. 6. So may we argue from Chriſts Aſcenſion, and prove that he is not in the Sacrament in that manner, as they of the Church of Rome; <hi>He is not there, for he is aſcended.</hi> And to this end did Chriſt ſpeak of his Aſcenſion, thereby to convince ſome,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:111827:136"/> and to let them ſee how much they did miſtake his<note place="margin">Proptereà Aſcenſionis ſuaein coelum mentionem fècit, ut eos à corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li intellectu abſtraheret. Athanaſ. in illud Quicunque dixerit ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, &amp;c.</note> meaning, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that which he had ſpoken about eating his fleſh, in a carnal ſenſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was to be underſtood ſpiritually. <hi>When Jeſus knew in himſelf that his Diſciples murmured at it, he ſaid unto them, Doth this offend you? what and if ye ſhall ſee the ſon of man aſcend up where he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing, the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit, and they are life,</hi> John 6. 61, 62, 63. As if he ſhould have ſaid, the fleſhly manner of eating which you dream of, would avail nothing; that therefore which I ſpake, of eating my fleſh, is not ſo to be underſtood, but in a ſpirituall ſenſe; and that will more plainly appear by my aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven.</p>
            <p>Again, by Chriſts aſcenſion the Papiſts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed in reſpect of <hi>Crucifixes,</hi> and other ſuch like Images, which they make to repreſent Chriſt. For Chriſt hath purpoſely withdrawn himſelfe from us corporally, that we might acquaint our ſelves with him ſpiritually, and yet they will needs have ſome corporall repreſentation of him. Thus do they directly croſſe Chriſts intent in aſcending into heaven, which is, that now he ſhould not be knowne ſo as when he was upon the earth, <hi>viz.</hi> in a carnall, but in a ſpirituall manner. <hi>Though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>yet hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know we him no more,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 16. Not now
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:111827:136"/> any more after the fleſh, as being a man of ſuch a ſtature, ſuch a feature, &amp;c. This place doth utterly overthrow the repreſenting of Chriſt by an Image, it ſerving to no end but to breed carnall cenceits and apprehenſions of Chriſt, which now ſince Chriſts aſcenſion are not lawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Chriſts aſcenſion makes for our conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſerves to encourage us to goe unto God in all our neceſſities, and with confidence to pray unto him both for pardon of ſin, and for ſupply of whatſoever is needfull for us, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have ſuch a Mediatour, who is gone into heaven, there to appeare and make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us. <hi>If any man ſin,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 John 2. 1, 2. He is with the Father, for he is aſcended up to the Father, and therefore we may be ſure that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will be propitious to us for his ſake. <hi>Seeing then we have a great High Prieſt, that is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the heavens, Ieſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4. 14. 16. So Heb. 10. 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Having therefore brethren, boldneſſe to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way which he hath conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated for us, thorough the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh: And having an High Prieſt over the houſe of God, let us draw neare with a

            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Chriſts reſurrection was the beginning of his exaltation, his aſcenſion was a higher degree of it, and his ſitting at the right hand of God, yet higher then both, and the higheſt that may be: This degree of exaltation is peculiar unto Chriſt, whereas the other are common to him with his members: They ſhall all riſe from the dead, and aſcend up to heaven, <hi>David is not aſcended into the heavens,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2. 34. As yet <hi>David</hi> is not aſcended (in reſpect of the body, to which aſcenſion properly belongs) but he ſhall aſcend, and ſo all the Saints likewiſe; they ſhall be <hi>caught up together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the ayre and ſo ſhall be ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 17. But beſides Chriſt, none ever did or ſhall ſit at the right hand of God; this honour is not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to any other, whether man or Angell. <hi>For to which of the Angels ſaid God at any time, ſit on my right hand?</hi> Heb. 1. 13.</p>

Mark</hi> teſtifies of Chriſt, that <hi>he was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up into heaven, and ſate on the right hand of of God,</hi> Mar. 16. 19. And this Chriſt himſelfe did fore-tell, Luke 22. 69. <hi>Hereafter ſhall the Son of Man ſit on the right hand of the power of God.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> did prophecy of it long before, ſaying, <hi>The LORD ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right Hand untill I make thine Enemies thy footſtool,</hi> Pſal. 110. 1. which words were ſpoken concerning Chriſt as Chriſt himſelfe hath ſhewed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 41, 42, 43, 44, 45. And ſo <hi>S. Peter, Acts</hi> 2. 34, 35. And the Author of the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, c. 1. v. 13.</p>
            <p>But now let us ſee what is meant by Chriſts<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the phraſe of <hi>ſitting,</hi> as here it is uſed, and applied unto Chriſt, by the conſent of all, is metaphoricall, not denoting the ſite
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:111827:139"/> and poſture of Chriſts body, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acception of the word, but the honour and majeſty that Chriſt is in. Thus the word is figuratively uſed, becauſe Maſters uſe to ſit, and ſervants to ſtand, and wait upon them. <hi>Whether is greater, he that ſitteth at meat, or he that ſerveth? Is not he that ſitteth at meat?</hi> Luke 22. 27. So Kings uſe to ſit in their Thrones, and Judges and Magiſtrates in their ſeats of honour. <hi>Aſſuredly</hi> Solomon <hi>thy ſonne ſhall reigne after me, and he ſhall ſit upon my Throne,</hi> ſaid <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> 1 Kings 1. 13. So Exod. 18. 13. it is ſaid, that Moſes <hi>ſate to judge the people, and the people ſtood by</hi> Moſes, &amp;c.

            <p n="2">2. For the right hand of God, it muſt needs be taken, not properly, but metaphorically, God being a ſpirit, and therefore having no hand, either right or left, nor any bodily member whatſoever. It was a groſſe hereſie of the Anthropomorphites to hold God to be of humane form and ſhape, whereas Chriſt ſaith plainly <hi>that God is a ſpirit,</hi> Joh. 4. 24. And that a <hi>ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones,</hi> Luk. 24. 39. Therefore when hands, eys, ears and the like are attributed unto God in the Scripture,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> it is by a figurative kind of ſpeech, whereby in condeſcenſion to the weakneſſe of our capacity, that is attributed unto God, which properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto man, and not unto God: becauſe man doth hear with his ears, ſee with his eyes, &amp; work
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:111827:140"/> with his hands, therefore to ſhew that God doth hear, and ſee, and work; theſe bodily parts and members are attributed unto God, though properly they do not belong unto him. By the <hi>right Hand of God</hi> is often ſignified the force, might and power of God, <hi>Thy right Hand O Lord,</hi> ſaid Moſes, <hi>is become glorious in power, thy right hand O Lord hath daſhed in pieces the enemy,</hi> Exod. 15. 6. So <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 118. 15, 16. <hi>The right Hand of the Lord doth valiantly, The right Hand of the Lord is exalted; the right Hand of the Lord doth valiantly.</hi> But the right hand alſo is uſed to denote the more honourable place; as when <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the mother of <hi>Solomon</hi> went unto him, as he ſate on this Throne, he roſe up to meet her, and bowed himſelf unto her; and ſate down on his Throne, and cauſed a ſeat to be ſet for her; <hi>and ſhe ſate on his right Hand,</hi> 1 Kings 2. 19. So Pſal. 45. 9. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thy right Hand did ſtand the Queen in gold of Ophir.</hi> Thus Chriſt is ſaid to be at Gods right Hand, as being in higheſt honour next unto God, even as <hi>Bethſheba</hi> was ſet in higheſt place of honour next unto the King: Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God imports his Kingly power, and ſoveraign power over all creatures; that <hi>all power both in heaven and in earth is given unto him,</hi> as he ſaid, Mat. 28. 18. <hi>That he hath a name above every name, that at the name ef Jeſus every knee ſhould bow,</hi> &amp;c. that is, that all ſhould be ſubject unto him, Phil. 2. 9, 10. Whereas <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou thou on my right Hand, untill I make thine enemies thy footstool,</hi> Pſal. 110. 1. S. <hi>Paul</hi> in reference to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:111827:141"/> thoſe words, ſaith, <hi>For he muſt reign untill his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be made his footſtool,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 25. VVhereby we ſee that Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of God, and his reigning, are one and the ſame thing, So what is meant by Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God, the ſame Apoſtle ſheweth, Epheſ. 1. 20, 21, 22. Where he ſaith that God raiſed Chriſt from the dead, <hi>and ſet him at his own right Hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church.</hi> And ſo likewiſe <hi>S. Peter,</hi> who ſpeaking of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers being made ſubject unto him,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 22.</p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee both that it is ſo, that Chriſt doth ſit at the right hand of God, and alſo what is meant by it.</p>
            <p>And by this which hath been ſaid it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that Chriſt is ſaid to ſit at the right hand of God in reſpect of his humane nature. In that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he was humbled, and in that reſpect he was exalted, the divine nature properly being capable neither of the one, nor of the other. As man, he ſuffered, was crucified, dead and buried, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into hell; and ſo as man he roſe again, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heaven, and ſitteth at the right hand of God. The divine nature is ſaid to be humbled, not properly, as if it's glory was indeed dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but that aſſuming to it ſelf humane nature
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:111827:141"/> ſubject to infirmity, its glory did lie hid, and not appear, So alſo it is ſaid to be exalted, not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if any glory indeed were added unto it, but by the exaltation of that humane nature, which it aſſumed, it's glory is made to appear and ſhine forth. Now this glorious exaltation of Chriſts humane nature, did belong unto it by vertue of the hypoſtaticall union, and ſo was due unto Chriſt at the firſt moment that the two natures were united together in one perſon: but by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, for the working out of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſt did not enter into the poſſeſſion of his glory, till after his paſſion, <hi>Ought not Chriſt to ſuffer theſe things, and to enter into his glory?</hi> viz. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſuffering, Luk. 24. 26. It was his glory, that which of right did belong<note place="margin">Quomodo <hi>ſuam,</hi> ſi oportuit? &amp; quomodo <hi>oportuit,</hi> ſi <hi>ſuam?</hi> Si glorii ejus fuit, quomodo ut a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Here then we may ſee the glorious and tranſcendent excellency of Chriſt, even as man, and ſo in him the wonderfull exaltation of our humane nature. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindfull of him, and the ſon of man that thou viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test him? Thou haſt made him a little lower then the Angels, and haſt crowned him with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> Pſal. 8. 4, 5. Yea the man Chriſt is made a great deal higher then the Angels. <hi>We ſee Jeſus,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:111827:142"/> the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> having cited theſe words of <hi>David, who was made a little</hi>

               </note> (or for a little while) <hi>lower then the Angels, for the ſuffering of death, crowned with Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> Heb. 2. 9. Chriſt for a while, that he might ſuffer death for our Redemption, was lower then the Angels, being a man ſubject to infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but now he is crowned with glory and honour, whereby he is far above the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caution.</hi> But here we muſt beware of that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour which ſome have faln into: We muſt not think that becauſe Chriſt as man doth ſit at the right hand of God, therefore Majeſty and Glory properly divine and infinite is communicated to Chriſts humane nature. This is exceeding groſſe, and the very hereſie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who becauſe he would not with <hi>Nestorius</hi> divide the perſon of Chriſt, therefore falling into another extreme he would confound his natures, making the humane nature to be ſwallowed up (as it were) by the divine nature. But Chriſts glory doth not take away the truth of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it is exalted, but not<note place="margin">Gloria humanitatem non tollit, ſed extollit, non interfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For ubiquity, or being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, is proper and peculiar to the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the humane nature is not capable of it. <hi>He is not here</hi> (viz. in reſpect of the body)
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:111827:142"/> 
               <hi>for he is riſen,</hi> Luk. 24. 6. So he is not here (in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect)<note place="margin">Secundùm hanc formam non eſt putandus ubique diffuſus.

               </note> for he is aſcended into heaven, and there ſits at the right hand of God. Indeed Chriſt as God, when he was upon earth, was alſo in heaven, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 13. And ſo now in that reſpect being in heaven, he is alſo on earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. But as man he was not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when he was on earth, neither is he in that reſpect now on earth, when he is in heaven.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. This alſo makes exceedingly for the comfort of all ſuch as belong unto Chriſt, and are his; they need not fear either to want any good or to ſuffer any evill, ſeeing he to whom they belong, is ſo exalted over all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore able to protect them, and to provide for them: Are we afraid of the rage and malice either of men or Devills? Though they be too ſtrong for us, yet Chriſt is too ſtrong for them, and much leſſe are they able to reſiſt him, then we are to reſiſt them. This was enough to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and incourage <hi>Stephen</hi> notwithſtanding the fury of his adverſaries, that he ſaw Chriſt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the right hand of God ready to defend him, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 55, 56. So let us with the eye of faith look up unto Chriſt, and not fear what men or Devills can do unto us: When <hi>Saul</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the members of Chriſt upon earth, Chriſt from heaven ſpake unto him, and let him know that he did perſecute him, and that he had a hard match of it; <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecutest thou me?—I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuieſt; it is hard for
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:111827:143"/> thee to to kick againſt the pricks,</hi> Acts 9. 4, 5. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. it is ſaid that all things are put under Chriſts feet, and that he is head over all things to the Church, or for the Church, that is, for the comfort and welfare of the Church.</p>
            <p>Again, doth the guilt of ſin ſting and wound our conſciences? Let us conſider what a mighty Redeemer, Mediatour, and Advocate we have, <hi>Who when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſate down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that died, yea rather, that is riſen again, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8. 34.</p>
            <p>Again, do we want any thing that is good and needfull for us? We may go with boldneſſe unto God, and ask of him in the Name of Chriſt, whom he hath ſo exalted, as to ſet him at his own right hand. <hi>Adonijah</hi> thought himſelf ſure to ſpeed when he had <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> whom <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſo honor, to intercede for him; and ſo, had his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt been juſt and reaſonable, it had been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 17; 18, 19, 20. How much more may we be aſſured, that having Chriſt to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and intercede for us, we ſhall obtain what we ask in his Name? <hi>Whatſoever you ask the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my Name, he will give it,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, Joh. 16. 23. <hi>Therefore let us come with boldneſſe to the Throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in the time of need,</hi> Heb. 4. 16.</p>
            <p>Finally, whatever our trouble or diſtreſſe be, yet let us not be dejected nor diſmaied, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Chriſt is at Gods right hand, and as he
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:111827:143"/> is thus exalted, ſo we alſo as members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhall proportionably be exalted in due time: <hi>Run with patience the race that is ſet before you, looking unto Ieſus the Author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Croſſe, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God,</hi> Heb. 12. 1. <hi>If we ſuffer</hi> (with Chriſt) <hi>we ſhall alſo reign with him,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 12. <hi>To him that overcometh</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne,</hi> Rev. 3. 21.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. This alſo ſerves for the terror of ſuch as ſtand out againſt Chriſt, and will not come in, and ſubmit unto him: All the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are Chriſts enemies, (<hi>the enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. 18.) but eſpecially ſuch as having means and offers of grace, yet ſleight and deſpiſe them. Now if Chriſt be inveſted with ſuch dignity and power, then woe unto his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they muſt <hi>be made his footſtool,</hi> Pſal. 110. 5. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25.

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. Laſtly therefore, this may teach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh all to reverence Chriſt, and to ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>CHriſts ſitting at the right hand of God, is (as I have formerly ſhewed) the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his exaltation; and therefore his coming to judge both the quick and the dead, is not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree above it, but belongs unto it as a part of it: Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God (as hath been ſhewed) denotes that ſupreme power and dignity unto which Chriſt is exalted above all creatures: Now the moſt clear evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this dignity and power, in the full exerciſe of it, ſhall be ſeen by Chriſts coming to Judgement; then ſhall every knee be made to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:111827:145"/> bow unto him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10, 11. compared together: Therefore Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Judgement and his Kingdome are joyned together as equivalent, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. becauſe when Chriſt cometh to judgement, then his Kingdome ſhall be conſummated and made perfect. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as therefore in the Creed after the Article of Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God, it's ſaid, <hi>From thence he ſhal come to judge both the quick and the dead;</hi> thoſe words <hi>from thence,</hi> are not ſo to be underſtood, as if Chriſt ſhould come from the right hand of God to judge both the quick and the dead: No, Chriſt ſhall then eſpecially ſit (that is, appear to ſit) at the right hand of God, when he cometh to judgement. And ſo much Chriſt himſelf hath ſhewed us, ſaying, <hi>Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of Man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven,</hi> viz. to judgement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 64. But the words <hi>from thence</hi> have reverence unto heaven, which was mentioned in the Creed a little before; <hi>He aſcended into heaven, and</hi> (there) <hi>ſitteth at the right hand of God, from thence</hi> (that is, from heaven) <hi>he ſhall come to judge both the quick and the dead.</hi> Thus the Angells told the Diſciples, who beheld Chriſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,<note place="margin">De caelo venturus eſt ad ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vivos &amp; mortuos. <hi>Aug.

               <hi>This ſame Ieſus which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall come in like manner as you have ſeen him go into Heaven,</hi> Acts 1. 11. So <hi>S.

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But who are meant by the <hi>quick and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:111827:145"/> dead,</hi> vvhich are ſpoken of both in the Creed, and in the Scripture, as in the Text, and ſo in other places; as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. &amp; 1 Pet. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some by <hi>quick</hi> are ſaid to underſtand mens ſouls, and by <hi>dead</hi> mens bodies; as if when<note place="margin">Teſte Danco in Enchir.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad, the meaning were, that he ſhal judge both ſoul and body: but this is an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>duth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous expoſition. For by <hi>quick and dead</hi> are meant, not divers parts, but divers perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like as Rom. 14. 9. where it is ſaid, that <hi>to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. Auguſtine</hi> giveth<note place="margin">In Enchir. cap. 55.</note> two interpretations of theſe words, <hi>quick and dead.</hi> 1. That by <hi>quick</hi> are meant the righteous, and by <hi>dead</hi> the wicked, vvho are dead vvhileſt they live, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6. Dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
            <p>But neither is this interpretation to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for thus the words <hi>quick and dead,</hi> are taken metaphorically, and not properly, whereas we ought not to recede from the propriety of words, except neceſſity enforce thereunto, which here it doth not. 2. That by <hi>quick</hi> vve are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe vvho are novv alive, or ſhall be alive at Chriſts coming; and by <hi>dead</hi> thoſe vvho are novv dead, or ſhall be at Chriſts coming: and this indeed is the true and genuine meaning of the vvords. The Scripture ſhevvs, that they vvho are alive at Chriſts coming, ſhall ſo remain, and they vvho vvere before dead, ſhall be raiſed up, and together vvith the other ſhall be judged; and in this ſenſe is it ſaid, that Chriſt ſhall judge both
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:111827:146"/> quick and dead; not that any ſhall be dead, when they are judged, but where as they were dead, they ſhall be raiſed up, and ſo be judged. Thus is that to be underſtood, Revel. 20. 12. <hi>I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great ſtand before God,</hi> viz. to be judged, as it there followeth; <hi>the dead,</hi> that is, thoſe who had been dead. And in oppoſition to theſe are the <hi>quick,</hi> that is, they who are found living when Chriſt cometh, and ſo remaining alive come to judgement. <hi>For the Lord himſelf,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, ſhal deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt. Then we which are alive, and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the ayre, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:111827:146"/> unto them. But there is no ground at all for any ſuch conceit: and that other parallel place of the Apoſtle is againſt it, <hi>viz.</hi> that 1 Cor 15. 51, 52. <hi>Behold, I ſhew you a myſtery; we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed in a moment, in a twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye, at the laſt trump, for the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d we ſhal be changed.</hi> Here the Apoſtle plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that the Elect (of which likewiſe he here ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) that are alive at Chriſts coming, ſhall not ſleep, that is, not die, but only ſhall be changed, that is, as he after explaineth it, of mortall ſhall be made immortall, and of corruptible incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Indeed this place to the Corinthians is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly read, and that was it that did miſlead <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> he followed another, and a contrary reading <hi>viz. We ſhall all riſe again,</hi> or <hi>We ſhall all ſleep, but we ſhall not all be changed,</hi> But theſe readings are falſe, and the other, which we have in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, and is found in the Greek, is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">See <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 51. 522.</hi>
               </note> as may appear by divers reaſons, 1. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this place to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that other to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> ſhould but ill agree; and therefore for the reconciling of them, <hi>Auſtin</hi> was fain to make that ſtrange quaere before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to imagine that which neither by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor by reaſon hath any probability for it. 2. If we ſhould read it thus, <hi>we ſhall not all be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> then the Apoſtle ſhould comprehend himſelf in the number of thoſe that periſh; for the change there ſpoken of, is a change unto glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, as appears by the words following: and therefore all the Elect have that change, only the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:111827:147"/> reprobrate have it not, though a change alſo they ſhall have, but a wofull and miſerable change, and not that which the Apoſtle there intendeth. 3. That which ſeemeth to me moſt convincing, is this, that except we ſhould read it as we do, <hi>We ſhal not all ſleep, but we ſhal al be changed,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face which the Apoſtle uſeth, were impertinent &amp; improper, <hi>Behold, I ſhew you a myſtery.</hi> For what myſtery is there in this, that all ſhall ſleep, and die, but not all be changed, that is, inherit glory &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life?

               </note> with ſuch a preamble, he would never have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it as a myſtery; for ſurely nothing is more obvious to every underſtanding, then that though all ſhall die, yet all ſhall not enjoy the life to come. But this is a myſtery indeed, except the Apoſtle had by the ſpirit of God revealed it, we ſhould have been ignorant of it, that all ſhall not die, but that ſome ſhall be exempted from death, and without the intervention of death ſhal paſſe from this life to another incomparably bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some may object that Heb. 9. 27. <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto men to die once.</hi> And how then ſhould the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep,</hi> that is, die?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this objection is eaſily anſwered; <hi>Cajetane</hi> ſpeaks briefly, but pithily, <hi>Statutum regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare</hi>

               <hi>eſt, illos autem non mori ſingulare eſt,</hi> That is, the Statute or appointment for men to die, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and ordinary, but for thoſe who remain at Chriſts coming, not to die, is ſingular and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:111827:147"/> And ſo neceſſarily thoſe words, <hi>It is appointed unto men to die once:</hi> muſt be underſtood of Gods uſuall and ordinary diſpenſation; for by <hi>once</hi> there is meant onely once, as appears by the context; yet we know that <hi>Lazarus</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were raiſed from the dead to this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, did die more then once: and beſides, the Scripture ſhews that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> were ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated<note place="margin">See <hi>Calvin</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor. 15.</hi>
               </note> and taken from the earth, as not to die once. Some further anſwer, that the change, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, ſhall be as a kind of death; but being no ſeparation of ſoul and body, it is not properly death; I therefore rather acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the former anſwer. And ſo alſo is that to be underſtood, which <hi>Austin</hi> objecteth, <hi>That which thou ſoweſt, it is not</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quomodo, quos viventes hic Chriſtus inveniet, per immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem in illo vivificabuntur, etſi non moriuntur, cum videamus propter hoc eſſe dictum, <hi>Tu quod ſeminas, &amp;c. Aug. de Civ. Dei l. 20. c. 20.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>quickned except it die,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 36. The Apoſtle there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſpeaks of that which is regular and ordinary, and ſo it is true, regularly and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily none are quickned, that is, inherit eternall life, but they firſt die: yet this hinders, not but that in reſpect of ſome it may be otherwiſe by a ſingular and extraordinary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge vouchſafed unto them. So it was with <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah,</hi> and ſo it ſhall be with thoſe that are alive at Chriſts coming to judgement.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed for the underſtanding of thoſe words, <hi>quick and dead,</hi> from the Text I ſhall deduce two points whcih clearly ariſe from it, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That both quick and dead, even all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally whoſoever they be, muſt be judged.</p>
            <pb n="286" facs="tcp:111827:148"/>
            <p>2. That Chriſt is he who muſt be the Judge of all, both of quick and dead.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, That all generally ſhall be judged, the Scripture is plain and expreſſe, <hi>Heb. 9. 27. It is appointed unto men to die once, and after this the Judgement,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 14. <hi>God will bring every work to judgement,</hi> Heb. 6. 2. the judgement to come there called <hi>eternall judgement,</hi> to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from judgements executed here, which are but temporall, that judgement, I ſay, is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongſt <hi>the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt;</hi> as they are there called, v. 1.</p>
            <p>This truth alſo may be confirmed by divers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The judgements which God hath already executed, or doth execute upon tranſgreſſors, prove that there is a judgement to come; <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> maketh uſe of this argument, from Gods dealing with the Angells that ſinned, with the old world, and with Sodome and Gomorrah, he infers, that God will at length meet with all the wicked, that thoſe fore-going judgements are tokens of this judgement which is to come; <hi>If God ſpared not the Angells that ſinned, but caſt them down to hell, &amp;c. And ſpared not the old world, &amp;c. And turning the Cities of Sodome and Gomorrah into aſhes, condemned them with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, &amp;c. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the righteous out of temptation, and to reſerve the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked unto the day of Judgement to be puniſhed,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 4. 9</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mans own conſcience is enough to convince him of this, that all ſhall be judged: For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:111827:148"/> will check and reprove for doing ill, though otherwiſe amongſt men none know of it, or if ſome do, yet either they cannot, or will not puniſh for it. When <hi>David</hi> had but cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, whereas ſome would have had him cut off his head, his heart ſmotehim for it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5. And ſo when he had ſinned in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the people to be numbred, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. On the other ſide, conſcience will comfort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage in doing well, though in the world one be traduced and ſlandered as an evill doer: <hi>This is our rejoycing</hi> (ſaid the Apoſtle) <hi>even the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our conſcience, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 12. Neither is this work of conſcience only in the regenerate, but even in the unregenerate alſo. The Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gentiles who had but the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo a meer naturall conſcience, yet ſaith ſaith of them, that they <hi>ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another,</hi> Rom, 2. 15.</p>

And not only <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, who though guilty of much ſin, yet were indued with true grace, but even <hi>Pharoah</hi> himſelf when Gods hand was heavy upon him, cryed, <hi>peccavi,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have ſinned this time, the Lord is righteous, but I and my people are wicked,</hi> Exod. 9. 27. And ſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni Bezek</hi> a cruell Tyrant, when the Iſraelites had taken him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes, then his conſcience accuſed him of his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and he confeſſed that he was dealt with, as he had dealt with others, <hi>Judg. 1. 7.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:111827:150"/> not; to him that ſweareth, and to him that feareth an Oath.</hi> Yea, oftentimes ſo it is here in this world, that the wicked flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and proſper, whenas the righteous are afflicted and in miſery. Here prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> ſtayes at home, and takes his pleaſure, while godly <hi>Iacob</hi> is forced to indure much hardneſſe in a forraigne Countrey. Here <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> (a man of <hi>Belial</hi>) feaſts it like a King, while <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, is in want and penury. Yea, here <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a murtherer, is releaſed, and ſet at liberty, and Chriſt himſelfe is condemned and crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It muſt needs be therefore, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after there ſhall be a Judgement, wherein men <hi>ſhall diſcerne between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not,</hi> Mal. 3. 18. The ſufferings of the godly here in this life (as the Apoſtle tells us) are a <hi>manifeſt token of the righteous judgement of God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 5. <hi>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompenſe tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you that are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Ieſus ſhall appear, &amp;c.</hi> v. 6.</p>

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:111827:151"/> will judge the world,</hi> Acts 17. 21. This is that Judgement which is meant in thoſe places of Scripture which ſpeak of the day of Judgement, and ſo in the Text, and other places, where the judging of quick and dead is ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>Now there are d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vers reaſons why beſides the particular judgement there ſhould alſo be a generall judgment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the particular judgement reacheth only to the ſoule: the difference betwixt the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the wicked when they die, is in reſpect of the ſoul, not of the body; but the body ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been partner with the ſoul either in well or ill doing, reaſon requires that they ſhould both ſhare either in reward or puniſhment: <hi>We muſt all appear before the Iudgement-ſeat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evill,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. The things were done in the body; therefore the recompence muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived alſo in the body, and conſequently there muſt be a Judgement wherein both ſoul and body ſhall be judged.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The particular Judgement is ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to thoſe that live here in this world, they cannot ordinarily tell what ſentence doth paſſe upon any when they die; therefore it is meet that there ſhould be another judgement, which ſhall be open and manifeſt unto all, that ſo Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in his adminiſtrations towards men may be made clear and evident. Hence the Apoſtle calls the day of Judgement, <hi>the day of the revelation of the righteous judgement of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. Not
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:111827:152"/> ſimply the day of the righteous judgement of God, but the day of the revelation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement of God, that is, the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the righteous judgement of God ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and made manifeſt: Gods Judgement is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes righteous, <hi>Is there unrighteouſneſſe with God? God forbid,</hi> Rom. 9. 14. But here many times the righteouſneſſe of Gods Judgement doth not appear; <hi>David</hi> having ſaid that Gods righteouſneſſe is like the great mountains, that is, moſt firme and unmovable, addes immediately, that his judgements are a great deep, it is not eaſie for us to dive into them, or to find out the reaſon of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 6. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle cryes out, <hi>How unſearchable are his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his wayes paſt finding out?</hi> Rom. 11. 33. But in the great day of the Lord which is to come, Gods judgement ſhall not onely be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as it ever is, but alſo ſhall appear to be righteous, all ſhall clearly ſee the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The generall judgement is congruous and requiſite, beſides the particular judgement, for the greater comfort and honour of the godly, and for the greater horrour and confuſion of the wicked. What comfort and honour ſhall it be to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whenas they, who whileſt they lived here, were accounted as the filth and off-ſcouring of all things, and were expoſed to all kind of injuries and indignit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:111827:152"/> the only happy men, ſhall publikely in the ſight of all be adjudged to eternall torment? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking of the generall judgement, ſaith, that then Chriſt ſhall <hi>be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 10.

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This point concerning the iudgement to come, ſerves to convince many.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe mockers and ſcoffers mentioned by S. <hi>Peter; Knowing this firſt, that there ſhall come in the laſt daies ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, and ſaying, Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 3, 4. They mean of Chriſts coming to judgement? where is it? ſay they: as if they ſhould ſay, We have heard much of it, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee it, and becauſe they do not ſee it, neither will they believe it: ſo the Prophet <hi>Zephany</hi> tells of ſome <hi>that are ſetled on their lees, and ſay in their heart, the Lord will neither do good, neither will he do evil,</hi> Zeph. 1. 12. But the Prophet there ſhews that the Lord will puniſh ſuch as theſe, Prov. 19. 29. <hi>Judgements are prepared for ſcorners;</hi> Eſa 28. 22. <hi>Now therefore be ye not mockers leſt your bonds be made ſtrong;</hi> he ſpeaks of temporall Judgments that ſhall be inflicted on them, how much leſſe ſhall they eſcape eternall judgement? <hi>Enoch alſo</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iude) the ſeventh from</hi> Adam, <hi>prophecied of theſe, ſaying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:111827:153"/> of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him,</hi> Jude v. 14, &amp; 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hypocrites and formall profeſſors, <hi>who have a form of godlineſſe, but deny the power of it,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. Who think it enough to carry it fair outwardly in the eyes of men, not conſidering nor caring what they are in the ſight of God. But <hi>God will bring every work to iudgement, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or evill,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 14. <hi>He will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe, and will make manifeſt the counſells of the heart,</hi> 1 Tim. 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such preſumptuous ones, who though they be fooliſh &amp; ignorant, froward &amp; diſobedient, yet doubt not but that when they die they ſhal go to heaven. <hi>But be not deceived, God is not mocked; as a man ſoweth, ſo ſhall he reap,</hi> Gal. 6. 7. Chriſt will come <hi>in flaming fire, taking vengeance on thoſe that know not God, and obey not the Goſpell of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 8. And therefore woe unto all that remain either in their ignorance, or in their diſobedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. The conſideration of this judgement<note place="margin">Aug. Confeſ. l. 6. c. 6.</note> ſhould therefore ſtir us up unto repentance, and provoke us unto all holy obedience. What can work upon us, and prevail with us, if not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the judgement to come; <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Confeſſions teſtifies, that it was <hi>Metus Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, &amp; futuri judicii, the fear of death, and of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after death,</hi> which did bring him out of the deep gulf of ſin and ſenſuality, wherein he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:111827:153"/> ſwallowed up and drowned. And he ſaith that diſputing with his friends, <hi>de finibus bonorum &amp; malorum, of the chiefeſt good and evill,</hi> he ſhould have given the garland to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who made happineſſe to conſiſt in ſenſuall pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, but that he was perſwaded that after this life is ended, men ſhall receive of God according to their waies and doings, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> would not believe. Oftentimes in the Scripture is this conſideration uſed and urged as a forcible motive to repentance and circumſpect walking. <hi>Rejoyce O young man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, in thy youth, and let thine heart chear thee in the daies of thy youth, and walk in the waies of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eys,</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I know this is that which thou deſireſt, and art prone unto; well, do ſo if thou wilt, <hi>but know that for all theſe things God will bring thee unto judgement,</hi> Eccl. 11. 9. So Eccl. 12. 13, 14. <hi>Let us hear the concluſion of the whole matter. Fear God, and keep his Commandements; for this is the whole duty of man, for God ſhall bring every work to judgement:</hi> So S. <hi>Paul And the times of this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance God winked at, but now commandeth all men every where to repent, becauſe he hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 17. 30, 31. And 2 Cor. 5. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we labour, that whether preſent or abſent</hi> (that is, whether alive or dead) <hi>we may be accepted of him. For we must all appear before the Judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in the body, according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evill. Knowing therefore that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi> As if he ſhould
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:111827:154"/> ſay, ſurely this if any thing will perſwade them to have a care what they do, ſeeing there muſt be a judgement, wherein God will render unto them according to their deeds. So alſo S. <hi>Peter</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken of this judgement, infers from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>day,</hi> thinking that this judgement will not come yet, &amp; that there is time enough to prepare for it. The Scripture in many places tells us that the day of the Lord, the day of Judgement, will come <hi>as a thief,</hi> ſuddenly, when it is little expected by many, and therefore it behoves us to watch, and prepare for it continually, that it may not ſurprize us ere we be aware. <hi>Your ſelves know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly that the day of the Lord ſo cometh as a thief in the night. For when they ſhall ſay peace, and ſafety, then ſudden destruction ſhall come upon them, as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 2, 3. <hi>The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 10. <hi>If thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou ſhalt not know what houre I will come upon thee,</hi> Revel. 3. 3. <hi>Behold, I come as a thief, bleſſed is he that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> Revel. 16. 15. <hi>Watch therefore, for you know not what houre your Lord cometh. But know this, that if the good man of the houſe had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have ſuffered his houſe to be broken up. Therefore be ye alſo ready, for in ſuch an houre as you think not, the Son of Man cometh,</hi> Mat. 24. 42, 43, 44. <hi>Take ye heed, watch and pray, for you know
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:111827:154"/> not when the time is,</hi> Mar. 13. 23. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves leaſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life, and that day come upon you unawares. For as a ſnare will it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the earth: Watch ye therefore, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 21. 34, 35, 36. We ſee how earneſtly Chriſt admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thoſe that lived ſo many hundred years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, to take heed leaſt the day of judgement ſhould come on them ere they were aware.

But further, as the conſideration of judgement to come, ſhould deter us from all ſin, and provoke us unto all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ſo there are divers particular duties which it both ſerves to admoniſh us of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us unto. As 1. To take heed of judging, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring and condemning one another. This is not ſo to be taken, as ſome are apt to miſ-interpret and miſapply it, as if we might not admoniſh and reprove one another. <hi>He will needs make himſelf a Judge,</hi> ſaid the Sodomites of <hi>Lot,</hi> when he ſaid to them, <hi>Nay my brethren, I pray you do not ſo wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Gen. 19. 9. So when <hi>Moſes</hi> reproved one for
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:111827:155"/> doing his fellow wrong, preſently the man took him up ſaying, <hi>Who made thee a Iudge and a Ruler over us!</hi> Exod. 2. 14. But all in their places and callings ought to do this, Miniſters muſt do it; <hi>Theſe things teach and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority,</hi> Tit. 2. 15. <hi>Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2.

But though this be required of us, yet are we forbidden to be cenſorious: <hi>judge not, that ye be not judged,</hi> Mat. 7. 1. Yea becauſe vve muſt our ſelves be judged, therefore vve muſt not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to judge others. <hi>Why doest thou judge thy brother, or why doeſt thou ſet at nought thy brother? we ſhall all ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Christ, As it is written, As I live ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſſe to God. So then, every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelfe unto God. Let us not therefore judge one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother any more,</hi> Rom. 14. 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy; who art thou that judgeſt another?</hi> Jam. 4. 12. And how muſt we refrain from judging, becauſe of that judgement that is to come? we muſt take heed of judging further then we know, as of mens purpoſes and intentions further then they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt them by their actions. <hi>Judge nothing before the time, untill the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe, and will make manifeſt

For this is more then we know, we muſt leave it unto him, <hi>Who hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9. 18.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of people, who are eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally faulty in this kind, 1. Such as take upon them to judge and cenſure others, that ſo themſelves may ſeem the more pure, and the more perfect. As the depreſſing of the one ſcale is the lifting up of the other; ſo they think, that what they detract from others, they ſhall adde unto themſelves. See <hi>Abſalons</hi> hypocriticall cenſoriouſneſſe, 2 Sam. 15.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:111827:156"/> 3. 4. <hi>But thou art inexcuſable O man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt, for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf, for thou that judgeſt, doeſt the ſame things. But we are ſure that the judgment of God is according to truth, against them that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch things. And thinkeſt thou this, O man, that iudgeſt them, which do ſuch things, and doeſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the iudgement of God?</hi> Rom. 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>If a man think himſelf to be ſomething when he is nothing; he deceiveth himſelf. But let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man prove his own work, and ſo ſhall he have reioycing in himſelf alone, and not in another. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſhall bear his own burthen,</hi> Gal. 6. 3, 4, 5. <hi>My brethren be not many Masters, knowing that we ſhall receive the greater condemnation. For in many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>2. Such as wittingly and wilfully traduce and ſlander others, whoſe converſations they know to be holy and good, and even therefore they ſeek what they can to defame them. <hi>They think it ſtrange that you will not run with them to the ſame exceſſe of riot, ſpeaking evill of you.

            <p>2. To beware of abuſing that power that we have over, or above others. For though they be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to plead their own cauſe, and to vindicate themſelves, yet God at the laſt judgement, if not before, will plead their cauſe for them, and will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge them on thoſe that have done them wrong. <hi>Rob not the poor, becauſe he is poor, neither oppreſſe the afflicted in the gate.

               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:111827:156"/> Prov. 22. 22, 23, <hi>He that doth wrong, ſhall receive for the wrong that he doth, and there is no reſpect of perſons,</hi> Col. 3. 25. Therefore <hi>Masters give unto your ſervants, that which is iust and equall, knowing that ye alſo have a master in heaven,</hi> Col. 4. 1. This conſideration of Gods judgement to come wrought ſo upon <hi>Iob,</hi> that he durſt not oppreſſe either ſervants or others. <hi>If I did deſpiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the cauſe of my man-ſervant, or of my maid-ſervant, when they contended with me. What then ſhall I do when God ſtandeth up, and when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him?</hi> Job. 31. 13, 14. <hi>If I have lift up my hand againſt the father leſſe, when I ſaw my help in the gate</hi> (that is, when by his greatneſſe he could have eaſily eſcaped cenſure in the courts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane judicature) <hi>Then let mine arm fall from my ſhoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.

            <p>3. To ſhew mercy unto others, that we our ſelves in that great day may obtain mercy. <hi>With what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again,</hi> Mat. 7. 2. <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull for they ſhall obtain mercy,</hi> Mat. 5. 7. <hi>But he ſhall have iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy,</hi> Jam. 2. 13. Now we muſt be mercifull in forgiving. For how can we expect that God ſhould forgive us, if we will not forgive others? Chriſt hath taught us to pray, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive thoſe that treſpaſſe against us,</hi> And he adds, <hi>For if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you. But if ye forgive not
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:111827:157"/> men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes,</hi> Mat. 6. 14. 15. And to this end he propounded a Parable of a certaine King, who having forgiven one of his ſervants a great debt which he was never able to pay, when he heard how that ſervant would not remit a ſmall debt that his fellow-ſervant owed him, he was wroth with him, and exacted his debt of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 23. &amp;c. And the Application of the Parable is ſubjoyned v. 35. <hi>So likewiſe ſhall my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do alſo unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their treſpaſſes:</hi> Therefore <hi>let not the Sun go down upon your wrath,</hi> Eph. 4. 26.

And what account ſhall be made at the laſt judgement of this kind of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Chriſt hath plainly ſhewed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34. &amp;c. where he fore-tells how to thoſe who have been carefull to ſuccour and relieve others, he will ſay, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit ye the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink, &amp;c.</hi> On

And becauſe coveouſneſſe was the ſin which was predominant in them, as appears,

               <hi>Luke 16. 14. Mat.</hi> 23. 14. Therefore Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a remedy ſutable to the diſeaſe; as a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian will ſay, to ſuch as are given to exceſſe, Uſe abſtinence, and all will be well: So <hi>Daniel</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had been a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, exhorted him to the exerciſe of that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue eſpecially which was moſt contrary to the vice that reigned in him; <hi>Wherefore O King, let my counſell be acceptable unto thee, break off thy ſins by righteouſneſſe, and thine iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor,</hi> Dan. 4. 27.</p>
            <p>The error of the Papiſts alſo is here to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, They hold that by works of mercy we may ſatisfie for our ſins, and merit heaven: But it is only Chriſt, who <hi>is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 2. and who hath <hi>purchaſed eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 12.

            <p n="1">1. The proſperity of the wicked doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not a little vex and grieve the godly:

Pſal. 73. 2, 3. &amp;c. But what reaſon is there to envy the wicked, becauſe they proſper and flouriſh for a while, whenas at laſt God will pay them home, and they ſhall periſh for ever? <hi>The wicked is reſerved to the day of deſtruction, and ſhall be brought forth to the day of wrath,</hi> Job 21. 30. <hi>Pull them out as ſheep for the ſlaughter, and prepare them for the day of ſlaughter,</hi> Jer. 12. 3. <hi>When I thought to underſtand this, it was too painfull for me, untill I went into the Sanctuary of God, then underſtood I their end.

They are utterly conſumed with terrors: As a dreame when one awaketh, ſo O Lord when thou awakeſt thou ſhalt deſpiſe their image,</hi> Pſal. 73. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Therefore <hi>fret not thy ſelf becauſe of evill doers, neither be thou envious againſt the workers of iniquity: For they ſhall ſoon be cut down like the graſſe, &amp; wither as the green herb,</hi> Pſa. 37. 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are apt to be troubled at the diſorder and confuſion that is in the world, that much ſin and wickedneſſe doth paſſe without controle, that judgement is perverted, the righteous are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the wicked juſtified: But let us

And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that all people, Nations and languages ſhould ſerve him, &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 7. 13, 14. This ſhews, that Chriſt as the Son of man, that is, as man, had a Kingdome given unto him of God; and to the adminiſtration of that Kingdome, this appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he ſhould judge the world. <hi>For he must reign untill hes enemies be made his footstool,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 25. Which ſhall be fulfilled at his coming to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:111827:161"/> judgement; then ſhal he exerciſe his Kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the full. And therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>he ſhal judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdome,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1. The reaſon why Chriſt is to be the Judge of all, is the will and pleaſure of God, it is his ordination and appointment, <hi>he is ordained of God to be the iudge of quick and dead,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> in the Text. So <hi>Paul</hi> Act. 17. 31. ſaith that God hath ordained him to judge the world.</p>
            <p>It is congruous and agreeable to reaſon that it ſhould be ſo in divers reſpects, 1. For a reward to Chriſts humiliation, <hi>for he that humbleth himſelf, ſhall be exalted,</hi> Luk. 18. 14. <hi>Now Chriſt humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe. Wherefore alſo God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth: And that every tongue ſhould confeſſe that Jeſus is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father,</hi> Phil. 2. 8, 9, 10, 11. The full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof ſhall be at the laſt judgment, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by comparing this place with that, Rom. 14. 10, 11. <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt. For it is written, As I live ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſſe to God.</hi> That which is written (to wit, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſai.</hi> 45. 23.) of every knee bowing unto God, and of every tongue confeſſing unto him, the Apoſtle interprets of Chriſt, as meant of him, and thence proves that all muſt ſtand before his judgement ſeat; for that then indeed ſhall every knee bow, that is, every one ſhall be ſubject unto him, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:111827:162"/> every tongue ſhall confeſſe him to be Lord over all. And thus ſome underſtand that, Ioh. 5. 27. <hi>And hath given him authority to execute iudgement alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man,</hi> that is (ſay they) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did ſo humble himfelf as to be made man, and being man to ſuffer as he did.</p>
            <p>2. That ſo the judiciall proceedings might be in an outward and viſible manner. And thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do more fitly expound that, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 27. Where it is ſaid that authority to execute judgment is given unto Chriſt, becauſe he is the ſon of man, that is, becauſe he only of all the three Perſons is man, and conſequently is meet ſo to execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that he may generally be ſeen of all. Thus it is ſaid, that when he cometh, <hi>every eye ſhall ſee him,</hi> Revel. 1. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But may ſome object, This honour to be the judge of all, is not peculiar unto Chriſt; for it is ſaid, that <hi>the Saints ſhall iudge the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, One may be ſaid to judge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies. 1. Comparatively, thus it is ſaid, Mat. 12. 41<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 42. <hi>The men of Nineve ſhal riſe in the iudgement with this generation, and ſhall condemn it, becauſe they repented at the preaching of</hi> Jonas; <hi>and behold, a greater then</hi> Jonas <hi>is here. The Queen of the South ſhall riſe up in the judgement with this generation, and ſhall condemn it; for ſhe came from the uttermoſt parts of the earth to hear the wiſdome of</hi> Solomon; <hi>and behold, a greater then</hi> Solomon <hi>is here.</hi> Thus alſo is it ſaid, Mat. 12. 27. <hi>If I by Belzebub caſt out devills, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they ſhall be your judges.</hi> Thus compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:111827:162"/> not only the Saints ſhall judge the wicked, that is, make it appear, that the wicked are juſtly to be condemned; but even the wicked alſo ſhall judge the wicked, ſome being far more groſſely then others.</p>
            <p>2. Interpretatively, by way of approbation: and thus alſo ſhall the Saints judge the world, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting unto, and approving of Chriſts judgment, as juſt and right. They ſhall ſay, as it is, Revel. 16. 5. <hi>Thou art righteous O Lord, which art, and wast, and ſhall be, becauſe thou haſt iudged thus.</hi>

            <p>3. Eminently, as an aſſeſſor and Bencher next unto the Judge.

            <p>THeſe words are a part of the concluſion of this Epiſtle. The Apoſtle uſually begins and ends with prayer in the behalf of thoſe to whom he writes. So in other Epiſtles, and ſo in this, <hi>Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Chap. 1. v. 2.

            <p>I am to treat only of that part of the verſe, which concerns the Holy Ghoſt, and before I come to the doctrine which the words afford, I muſt inſiſt a little upon the name, nature, perſon, and operation of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the name, <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Ghoſt is as much as<note place="margin">Of the name <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </note> ſpirit, and ghoſtly as much as ſpirituall. In the Scripture where this Perſon called the Holy Ghoſt, is ſpoken of, our Tranſlators ſometimes
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:111827:166"/> uſe the word <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> and ſometimes the word <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Yet (as I obſerve) they do not altogether uſe the words promiſcuouſly, but with this difference. Where the word <hi>Holy</hi> is not prefixed, they alwaies<note place="margin">The word <hi>Ghoſt</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> uſe the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not the word <hi>Ghoſt.</hi> And ſo alſo when this Perſon is ſpoken of in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, or to Chriſt, although the word Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be prefixed. As the Spirit, not the Ghoſt, the Spirit of God or of Chriſt, not the Ghoſt of God or of Chriſt: his holy Spirit, not his Holy Ghoſt. Otherwiſe when this Perſon is ſpoken of without any ſuch relation, and with the Epithite <hi>Holy</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, they uſe the word <hi>Ghoſt</hi> rather then <hi>Spirit.</hi> But however, the word in the Originall is the ſame, and theſe words <hi>Ghoſt</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> differ in ſound, rather then in ſenſe and ſignification.

               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:111827:166"/> whence we have the word <hi>Spirit.</hi> 3. This word <hi>Spirit</hi> is uſed to ſignifie an incorporeall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material ſubſtance. <hi>A ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones,</hi> Luk. 24. 39. And thus by ſpirit ſometimes is meant the ſoul of man. VVhen a man dies, <hi>then ſhall the duſt,</hi> that is, the body (made of duſt) <hi>return to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit ſhall return to God that gave it,</hi> Eccleſ. 22. 7. Where by <hi>ſpirit</hi> is meant the ſoul of man, which is a ſpirituall ſubſtance. Thus alſo the Angels, whether good or bad, are called ſpirits. The good Angels, <hi>Are they not all ministring ſpirits?</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 1. 14. The bad Angells, when ſome ſaid unto Chriſt, <hi>Lord, even the devils are ſubiect unto us thorough thy name,</hi> Luk. 10. 17. Chriſt anſwered them, <hi>Notwithſtanding in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not, that the ſpirits are ſubject unto you, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reioyce becauſe your names are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> v. 20. And in this ſenſe is the word <hi>Spirit</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto God, <hi>Ioh. 4. 24. God is a Spirit.</hi> And ſo 1 Pet. 3. 18. By <hi>ſpirit</hi> is ſignified Chriſts divine nature, which is the Son, in all the three Perſons. <hi>Being put to death by the fleſh</hi> (that is, the humane nature) <hi>but quickned in the ſpirit,</hi> that is, the divine nature. And peculiarly the third Perſon of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity hath the name of <hi>Spirit</hi> appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. Sometimes this Perſon is called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 16. Sometimes the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 2. Sometimes the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. Sometimes the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as in the Text, and other places. VVhy the third Perſon is peculiarly called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> though the Father be a ſpirit, and the Son a ſpirit as well as the Holy Ghoſt; the Scripture doth not expreſſe,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:111827:167"/> neither is it much material for us to inquire. Some give<note place="margin">Secundum quod ſpiritus dicitur à ſpiritualitate; ſic convenit toti Trinitati.—Secundum autem quod dicitur à ſpiratione, ſic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit illi ſoli Perſonae, quae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit ut amor, &amp;c. <hi>Bonavent.</hi> in <hi>Sent. l. 1. diſt. 10. queſt. 3.</hi>
               </note> this reaſon, that this Perſon proceeds from the Father and the Son by ſpiration, or breathing; which muſt be underſtood after a ſpirituall and ineffable manner. It may be ſaid, that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon is therefore called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe he was inſpired or breathed into, and did breath in the Prophets and Apoſtles.

Where it is ſaid, that when Chriſt gave the Holy Ghoſt unto his Apoſtles, <hi>he breathed on them, and ſaid unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Ioh. 20. 22. This Perſon is called <hi>Holy.</hi> Now there is a holineſſe, which is only externall and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which doth not conſtitute a thing holy in it ſelf, but only in its uſe and relation. Thus Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem is called <hi>the Holy City,</hi> Mat. 4. 5. to wit, becauſe<note place="margin">The word <hi>Holy</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> it had ſpeciall relation unto God, it was the <hi>City of the great King,</hi> that is, of God, Mat. 5. 35. Thus alſo the Temple, and the things of the Temple were holy. And thus the water in Baptiſm, and the bread and wine in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper are holy, as having peculiar reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and ſet apart for holy uſes. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an internall and inherent holineſſe, whereby a thing is in it ſelf holy. And thus all true believers
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:111827:167"/> are holy, being inwardly purged and cleanſed in ſome meaſure from the filth and pollution of ſin. <hi>You are waſhed, you are ſanctified,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe both of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. Thus alſo the good Angels are holy, they are called the <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> Mat. 25. 31. And after a moſt eminent manner God is holy, he is ſtiled <hi>the Holy one,</hi> Iob. 6. 10. Iſai. 40. 25. Yea it is ſaid that he only is holy, Revel. 15. 4. to wit, independently and eſſentially, men and Angels being but holy by participation. And peculiarly holineſſe is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the third Perſon in the Bleſſed Trinity; though the firſt perſon and the ſecond perſon be holy too, yet the third perſon is peculiarly ſtiled holy, it being the peculiar work of this perſon to ſanctifie and make holy. Not as if the Father and the Son did not ſanctifie as well as the Holy Ghoſt, but the Father and the Son do ſanctifie by the Holy Ghoſt; whence ſanctification is called <hi>the ſanctification of the ſpirit,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 13. becauſe it is peculiarly wrought by the ſpirit, and ſo much for the name Holy Ghoſt, or holy Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The nature of the holy Ghoſt is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> that the holy Ghoſt is God truly and<note place="margin">Of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Holy Ghoſt that the Holy Ghoſt is God.</note> properly ſo called, having one and the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature with the Father and the Son, for <hi>theſe three are one,</hi> 1. Ioh. 5. 7. three perſons, yet but one God, as hath been ſhewed before upon that Text; but here the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt is to be proved more fully: and we have clear teſtimony of Scripture for it: <hi>VVhy hath Satan filled thine
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:111827:168"/> heart, to lie unto the Holy Ghost?</hi> ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias,</hi> Act. 5. 3. And he adds preſently after, <hi>Thou haſt not lied unto men, but unto God,</hi> v. 4. This clearly ſhews the Holy Ghoſt to be God. And the ſame may further be confirmed by divers arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Divine attributes belong unto the holy Ghoſt, ſuch as are proper unto God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Holy Ghoſt is God. Ubiquity, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence, to be every where, which is peculiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, is attributed to the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy ſpirit?</hi> Pſal. 139. 7. So alſo is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, to know all things, which likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to God only: <hi>The ſpirit ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Divine works are aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt, ſuch works as none can do but only God, and therefore alſo the Holy Ghoſt is God. The work of Creation, which is proper unto God, belongs to the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 33. 4. And ſurely he that made him, made all. So alſo the work of ſanctification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only unto God; <hi>The very God of peace ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you wholly,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 23. Yet this work is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Holy Ghoſt; yea this Perſon (as hath been ſhewed) is therefore called the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe he peculiarly doth work ſanctification, and make holy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Divine honour is given to the Holy Ghoſt, that honor which is due only unto God: And this alſo evinceth that the Holy Ghoſt is God: <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. We may not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, or be baptized in the name of any, but only
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:111827:168"/> of God. <hi>Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul?</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 13. Seeing therefore that we bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize and are baptized, according to Chriſts own inſtitution, as in the name of the Father, and of the Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo alſo of the holy Ghoſt, it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows that as the Father is God, and the Son God, ſo is the Holy Ghoſt God alſo. And ſo in the Text, that we have in hand, the Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, as the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt (the Son) and the love of God (the Father) ſo likewiſe the communion of the Holy Ghoſt; and it is an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit invocation as of Chriſt the Son, and of God the Father, ſo of the holy Ghoſt; as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, I pray to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that his grace, and to God (the Father) that his love, and to the Holy Ghoſt, that his communion may be with you all: and this may ſuffice to prove that the holy Ghoſt is God.</p>
            <p>3. I paſſe to the perſon of the holy Ghoſt; and<note place="margin">Of the perſon of the Holy Ghoſt.</note> here three things are to be conſidered. 1. That the Holy Ghoſt is a Perſon. 2. That the Holy Ghoſt is a perſon diſtinct from the Father and the Son. 3. That the Holy Ghoſt is a perſon proceeding both from the Father, and from the Son.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The holy Ghoſt is a perſon, not an attribute<note place="margin">That the H. Ghoſt is a perſon.</note> or affection, as mercy, juſtice, power, wiſdom, and the like. For thoſe things which are proper and peculiar to a perſon are attributed to the holy Ghoſt, as to be vexed &amp; grieved, <hi>They vexed his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit,</hi> Iſai. 63. 10. <hi>Grieve not the holy ſpirit of God,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 30. True it is, the holy Ghoſt being God, cannot properly be vexed or grieved, but this (as
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:111827:169"/> other things in Scripture) is ſpoken after the manner of men, but however it argueth that the holy Ghoſt is a perſon, even as that Pſal. 95. 10. <hi>Fourty years long was I grieved with this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſhews him that ſpake it, to be a perſon. So when the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to ſpeak, to command and injoyn, it argues that the Holy Ghoſt is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, &amp;c. Act. 13. 2. Above all, that <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16. is moſt ſtrong and forcible for this purpoſe. There it is ſaid, that the Holy Ghoſt came down in the likeneſſe of a dove, which could not be except the Holy Ghoſt were a perſon: For nothing but a perſon can aſſume a ſhape wherein to appeare; a meer attribute or affection cannot do it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Holy Ghoſt is a perſon diſtinct from the<note place="margin">That the H. Ghoſt is a perſon diſtinct from the Father and the Son.</note> Father and the Son. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to his Diſciples, Joh. 14. 16. The Comforter there ſpoken of is the Holy Ghoſt, as appears v. 17. <hi>Even the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth,</hi> &amp;c. and v. 26. <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This therefore is another, a perſon diſtinct from Chriſt the Son, and ſo likewiſe from the Father. For the Father doth ſend this Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Holy Ghoſt, Iohn 14. 26. Now the perſon ſending, and the perſon ſent muſt needs be diſtinct the one from the other. And this ſame reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo proveth the Son and the Holy Ghoſt to be two diſtinct perſons, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt is ſent by the Son; <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, Joh. 15. 26. And ſo Ioh. 16. 7. <hi>If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will ſend him unto
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:111827:169"/> you.</hi> The diſtinction alſo of the Holy Ghoſt both from the Father, and from the Son, is evident by that Mat. 28. 19. <hi>Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son; and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> As likewiſe by this concluſion, whereof the Text is a part, <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all.</hi> Theſe places do clearly ſhew that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſons: and ſo <hi>S. John</hi> ſpeaking of them,<note place="margin">That the H. Ghoſt proceedeth both from the Father, and from the Son.</note> ſaies, <hi>There are three,</hi> and <hi>theſe three,</hi> 1 Ioh. 5. 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son: this is the difference, whereby the divine perſons are diſtinguiſhed one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: the Father proceedeth from none, the Son proceedeth from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth both from the Father and the Son: that the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father, the Scripture is expreſſe, Ioh. 15. 26. <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth; which proceedeth from the Father.</hi> And that the Holy Ghoſt alſo proceedeth from the Son, is there implied, <hi>Whom I wil ſend,</hi> ſaid Chriſt. If the holy Ghoſt be ſent by the ſon, then alſo he proceedeth from the Son, for the Father procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from none, is never ſaid to be ſent by any; the<note place="margin">

And ſo the Holy Ghoſt, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is ſaid to be ſent by them both: the Holy Ghoſt alſo is called the <hi>ſpirit of the Son,</hi> as proceeding from the Son, Gal. 4. 6. And ſo Rom. 8. 9. the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt:</hi> therefore alſo Chriſt ſpeaking of the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:111827:170"/> Holy Ghoſt, ſaid, <hi>He ſhall receive of mine,</hi> Ioh. 16. 14. becauſe the holy Ghoſt hath the divine nature communicated unto him by the Son, even as the Son hath it communicated unto him by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may ſay, How is it ſaid of the Holy Ghoſt, that <hi>he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak?</hi> Ioh. 16. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, The Holy Ghoſt is there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as a meſſenger, or an Embaſſadour, one ſent by another, who is not to ſpeak of himſelf, but what he hath received from him by whom he is ſent: and Chriſt ſpake thus of the Holy Ghoſt, not to derogate from the Holy Ghoſt, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſpreading of errour and falſe doctrine, under a pretence of the ſpirit, and to aſſure us, that if any Doctrine be diſſonant from that which Chriſt hath delivered, it is not from the Holy Ghoſt, but to be rejected, though they that vent it, doe never ſo much pretend the ſpirit for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the fourth and laſt place we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Holy Ghoſt.</note> the operation of the Holy Ghoſt. In reſpect of operation it is that the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to be ſent, or given, <hi>Gal. 4. 6. Rom.</hi> 5. 5. For the Holy Ghoſt is not ſo ſent, or given, as to be where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not, but only ſo as to operate other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then he did. The operation of the ſpirit is called, <hi>the manifeſtation of the ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 7. becauſe by the operation of the ſpirit, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſpirit is made manifeſt, the operation it ſelf being ſuch as is manifeſt.</p>
            <pb n="331" facs="tcp:111827:170"/>
            <p>Now the operation of the ſpirit is either ſuch as is common to the Elect and reprobate, or ſuch as is proper and peculiar to the Elect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as is common to the Elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: and that is of divers ſorts. 1. That whereby one is fitted for his particular calling, whether it be ſacred or civill. It is Iudg. 11. 29. <hi>that the ſpirit of the Lord came upon</hi> Iephthah. And 1 Sam. 11. 6. <hi>that the Spirit of the Lord came upon</hi> Saul. So Exod. 31. 3. that Bezaleel <hi>was filled with the ſpirit of God.</hi> The meaning is, that <hi>Iephthah</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Spirit were indued with courage and valour, and <hi>Bezaleel</hi> with wiſdome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, whereby both they and he were made meet for that office, and imployment to which they were called. In the primitive times of the Goſpel, there were extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, as ability to ſpeak ſtrange tongues, to work ſtrange cures, and to do many miracles; and theſe gifts were common to the reprobate, as appears by that, Mat. 7. 22, 23. <hi>Many will ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophecied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out devills, and in thy name done many wonderfull works? And then will I profeſſe unto them, I never knew you, Depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi> And when Chriſt ſent the Apoſtles, giving them power to heal the ſick, to cleanſe the lepers, to raiſe the dead, and to caſt out devils, he ſent <hi>Iudas</hi> among them, and gave him power in this kind as well as the reſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1. &amp;c. And in reſpect of thoſe extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, moſt probably it was, that ſome being asked if they had received the Holy
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:111827:171"/> Ghoſt, anſwered, <hi>We have not ſo much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 19. 2. It is hardly to be imagined, that they who ſpake this, having been partakers (as they ſaid themſelves) of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, could be ignorant whether there were ſuch a divine Perſon which is called the Holy Ghoſt; but they might be ignorant whether there were ſuch miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt given unto believers: It followes there v. 6. that <hi>when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they ſpake with tongues, and prophecied.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt did then manifeſt himſelf in them by extraordinary gifts which he did confer on them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some meaſure of illumination: This alſo is a common work of the Spirit; the reprobate are illuminated in ſome meaſure by the Holy Ghoſt, as well as the elect. They who are inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in that reſpect made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, may fall away and periſh for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 6. The ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth this operation of the Holy Ghoſts illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: None can fall into this ſin, but they that are inlightned ſo as to know the truth, and to be convinced of it, and yet out of diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall malice do impugne and oppoſe it; as they that knew and were convinced in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that Chriſt did caſt out Devills by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, and yet would blaſpheme and ſay, that he did it through <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devills; which occaſioned Chriſt to ſpeak of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and of the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 22. 30.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:111827:171"/>3. Some ſtirring of the affections: this is likewiſe an operation of the Holy Ghoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the wicked with the godly: thus the Holy Ghoſt did operate in Agrippa, when he ſaid unto <hi>Paul, Almoſt thou perſwadest me to be a Christian,</hi> Act. 26. 28. And ſo in <hi>Felix,</hi> when hearing <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak of righteouſneſſe; temperance, and judgement to come, he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some reſtraining grace, whereby to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from acting the evill which otherwiſe one would act; this alſo the Holy Ghoſt doth work, as well in the unregenerate, as in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. It is probable, that this was all that was wrought in <hi>Abimelech,</hi> to whom God ſaid, that he withheld him from ſinning againſt him, and ſuffered him not to touch <hi>Sarah,</hi> as he thought to have done, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 6. Theſe operations of the Holy Ghoſt are common.</p>
            <p>2. There is an operation of the ſpirit, which is proper to the Elect. As 1. Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby one is ſo changed, as in a ſpirituall ſenſe to be borne again, and to be a new creature. <hi>That which is born of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is ſpirit,</hi> John 3. 6. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſſe, which we have done, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (that is, renewing wrought by the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>which he ſhed on us abundantly, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 3. 5, 6. This work of the Holy Ghoſt is peculiar to the Elect. <hi>God hath
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:111827:172"/> from the beginning choſen you unto ſalvation, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſanctification of the ſpirit,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 13. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this operation of the ſpirit, ſome are <hi>ſenſuall, not having the ſpirit,</hi> Jude v. 19.</p>
            <p>2. Direction; whereby to be guided in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and ſaving truth, and to be kept from all deſtructive and damnable errour, either in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or practice. <hi>I will put my ſpirit wtthin you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 36. 27. <hi>When the ſpirit of truth is come, he wil guide you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth.</hi> Joh. 16. 13. This promiſe might have peculiar reference to the Apoſtles, who were gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſpirit after an extraordinary manner; but in reſpect of things neceſſary unto ſalvation, it belongs to all believers, and to them only. <hi>For as many as are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſons of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 13.</p>
            <p>3. Conſolation and incouragement in greateſt troubles and afflictions. The Holy Ghoſt is called <hi>the Comforter,</hi> Ioh. 14. 16, 17, &amp; 15. 26. &amp; 16. 7. The wicked and reprobate may have ſome comfort and incouragement, but it is frothy and fading, whereas that which is wrought in the godly by the Holy Ghoſt is ſolid and permanent. <hi>We glory in tribulations alſo, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, And hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God,</hi> (the aſſurance of Gods love to us in Chriſt) <hi>is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us,</hi> Rom. 5. 3, 4, 5. <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it ſelfe beareth witneſſe together with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God; and if children, then heirs,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8. 16, 17. By the ſpirit the Saints are
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:111827:172"/> 
               <hi>ſealed unto the day of Redemption,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 30. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our hearts,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 22. As a ſeale ſerves to confirm a writing, and an earneſt to make a bargain ſure; ſo the children of God by the Holy Ghoſt are confirmed in their faith, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of Gods love towards them, and of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happineſſe.</p>

            <p>HAving diſcourſed in generall of the Holy Ghoſt, I come to the Doctrine which the words of the Text do offer unto our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> That the communion, participation, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> and fellowſhip of the Holy Ghoſt is a thing much<note place="margin">That which in the Text is called <hi>the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is called, Phil. 2. 1. the <hi>fellowſhip of the ſpirit.</hi> As the ſame word in the Originall, that is rendred in the one place <hi>communion,</hi> in the other <hi>fellowſhip.</hi>
               </note> to be deſired.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle in the very concluſion of his Epiſtle praies for thoſe to whom he writes, that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this communion, which argues that it is a thing very precious and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>The ſame may appear by that which we read of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who when <hi>Eliah</hi> being to be taken from him, bad him ask what he ſhould do for him, made only this requeſt, <hi>I pray thee, let a double portion of thy ſpirit be upon me,</hi> 2 Kings 2. 9. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not (as ſome are apt to miſtake it) that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> deſired to have twice as much of the Spirit as <hi>Eliah</hi> had, but the phraſe there uſed, is the ſame with that which is uſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 17. and from thence the true and genuine meaning is to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:111827:174"/> be fetched. There it is ſaid, that the firſt born was to have a double portion, word for word, <hi>the mouth of two,</hi> that is, he was to receive twice as much of his Fathers ſubſtance as any of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; So <hi>Eliſha</hi> deſired, that he might be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as <hi>Eliahs</hi> firſt borne, and that he might have twice as much of the Spirit which was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as the other Prophets ſhould have: Thus is the place to be underſtood; but ſtill it ſhewes what account <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who had already ſo much of the Spirit, as to know the worth of it, did make of this communion of the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>David</hi> alſo, by whom the Spirit of the Lord did ſpeak, as he ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23 2. when his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was afflicted for his foule and grievous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities, was very ſollicitous in this reſpect, leſt he ſhould not injoy the communion of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, as he had done; <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence</hi> (ſaies he unto God) <hi>and take not thy holy Spirit from me,</hi> Pſal. 51. 11. And v. 12. <hi>Restore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation, and ſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How the communion of the Holy Ghoſt is to be prized, we may likewiſe perceive by thoſe exhortations of the Apoſtle, <hi>Quench not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 19. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4. 30. <hi>Be filled with the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 5. 18. So alſo by that commemoration which the people of God made unto him of his ſingular favour ſhewed unto their Fathers, <hi>Thou gaveſt alſo thy good Spirit to inſtruct them,</hi> Neh. 9. 20.</p>
            <p>For the further confirmation of the point, let us conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:111827:175"/>1. The excellency of this communion, which appears by the excellency of the Holy Ghoſt: This Spirit is called <hi>good,</hi> Neh. 9. 20. <hi>excellent,</hi> Dan. 6. 3. <hi>the ſpirit of wiſdome,</hi> Eph. 1. 17. <hi>the ſpirit of truth,</hi> Joh. 15. 26. &amp; 16. 13. <hi>the ſpirit of grace,</hi> Zach. 12. 10.

Yea, this Spirit is God, as hath been proved before; and therefore this ſpirit muſt needs be excellent, and ſo conſequently the communion or fellowſhip of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The commodity of this communion of the holy Ghoſt: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Holy Ghoſt will teach, informe, and inſtruct; <hi>Thou gavest thy good ſpirit to inſtruct them,</hi> Neh. 9. 20.

We are naturally blind and ignorant of the truth, and many errors creep in, and inſinuate themſelves under the name of truth; but the Holy Ghoſt is the <hi>ſpirit of truth,</hi> and will inlighten our minds, and teach us to know and underſtand the truth: <hi>Joh. 14. 26. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you:</hi> Joh. 14. 26. <hi>Howbeit when the ſpirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth,</hi> Joh. 16. 13.

How weak and fearfull were the Apoſtles whilſt they had but (as it were) a ſcantling of the Spirit?
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:111827:176"/> They all forſook Chriſt, and fled from him, when he was apprehended by his adverſaries: and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> who had profeſſed moſt courage and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of all others moſt bewrayed his weakneſſe, being not able to indure the encounter of a ſilly damoſell, as the ſtory ſhews of him.

This is the ſtone, which was ſet at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Neither is there ſalvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved. Now when they ſaw the boldneſſe of Peter and</hi> John, <hi>and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jeſus,</hi> Act. 3. 7. 13.

            <p n="3">3. The Holy Ghoſt will direct and order. Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage without wiſdom and diſcretion, will do hurt rather then good; but wiſdome and courage joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together will do much good, and no hurt. <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time and iudgment,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 8. 5. that is, a wiſe man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both when to do a thing, and how to do it. Now the Holy Ghoſt being <hi>the ſpirit of wiſdome,</hi> will order and direct us to do things wiſely, in due time, and in right manner. <hi>Stephen</hi> being full of the Holy Ghoſt, was alſo full of wiſdome, ſo that although he had to do with moſt implacable adverſaries, yet <hi>they were not able to reſist the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the ſpirit by which he ſpake,</hi> Act. 6. 10. So Chriſt promiſed unto his Diſciples ſaying, <hi>I will give you a mouth, and wiſdom, which all your adverſaries ſhall not be able to gain-ſay or reſiſt,</hi> Luk. 21. 15. And how they ſhould be indued with ſuch wiſdom, we may ſee by that, <hi>Luk. 12. 12.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Holy Ghoſt will comfort and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as to do the will of God, ſo alſo to ſuffer what by his permiſſion and providence ſhall be inflicted for ſo doing. For though the godly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves never ſo well and wiſely, yet they may fall into the hands of their inraged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, as that <hi>Protomartyr Stephen,</hi> and ſo the other Martyrs did. But though they do, yet (as it fared with <hi>Stephen</hi> and the Martyrs) as their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:111827:177"/> abound, ſo ſhall their conſolations abound alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. For the ſpirit of glory, and of God reſteth on them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. And this ſpirit will make them to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. It is ſuch a peculiar work of the Holy Ghoſt to afford comfort, that he is ſtiled <hi>the Comforter,</hi> Ioh. 14. 16. 26. &amp; 15. 26. &amp; 16. 7. And ſound joy is called, <hi>joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14. 17.</p>
            <p>3. Conſider we the neceſſity of this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Without the Holy Ghoſt we can know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>viz.</hi> of the things of God, the things that concern ſalvation. <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo the things of God knoweth no man but the ſpirit of God. Now we have received not the ſpirit of the world; but the ſpirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given unto us of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11. 12. &amp; v. 14. <hi>But the naturall man</hi> (who is deſtitute of Gods ſpirit) <hi>receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him, neither can he know them, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Without the Holy Ghoſt we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that is pleaſing unto God. Not pray, for the Holy Ghoſt is <hi>the ſpirit of grace and of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi> Zach. 12. 10. <hi>Likewiſe the ſpirit alſo help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us, with groanings that cannot be utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the ſpirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               </gap> 27. So neither can we without the Holy Ghoſt rightly hear the word, or receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or perform any other duty whatſoever. For the Holy Ghoſt being the <hi>Spirit of grace,</hi> without the Holy Ghoſt we can have no grace: and we muſt <hi>have grace, whereby to ſerve God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably,</hi> Heb. 12. 28. Whatſoever ſervice is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the unregenerate, who are not indued with Gods ſpirit, though in it ſelf conſidered it is pleaſing unto God, yet as done by them, God is not pleaſed with it. <hi>They that are in the fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8. 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Without the Holy Ghoſt we can enjoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that is truly good for us. The Holy Ghoſt being the Spirit of Chriſt, and of God, we can have no communion with Chriſt, nor with God but by the Holy Ghoſt. The Holy Ghoſt being the ſpirit of life, the ſpirit of grace, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of glory, without the holy Ghoſt we can have no life, neither of grace here, nor of glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: therefore we have that hope which maketh not aſhamed, <hi>becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt which is given unto us,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. This may ſuffice to demonſtrate what a deſirable thing the communion of the holy Ghoſt is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. And if it be ſo, then O the wretched folly and madneſſe of many, who deſire and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for any thing rather then for this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let <hi>Eliſha,</hi> or whoſoever will ſeek a double portion of the ſpirit, ſo they may have a double portion of the things of the world, of the profits,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:111827:178"/> pleaſures and honours of it, it's all they deſire. If the holy Ghoſt in the mouths of his Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ters ſtrive with them, they oppoſe and reſiſt him all they can. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, you do alwaies reſiſt the Holy Ghost, as your Fathers did, ſo do ye,</hi> Act. 7. 51. If the holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate himſelf a little into them, putting good motions into them, preſently they quench the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which the Apoſtle bids Chriſtians beware of, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 20. ſaying, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit,</hi> that is, the good motions of the ſpirit, which like ſparks are kindled within you. If the holy ſpirit begin to ſearch them, and to diſcover their ſins unto them, and to put them in mind of their eſtate to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they are weary of ſuch a gueſt. Like <hi>Felix,</hi> who when <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned before him of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and temperance, and judgment to come, trembled and ſaid, <hi>Go thy way for this time, when I have convenient ſeaſon I will ſend for thee,</hi> Act. 24. 25. They judge this ſpirit to be a ſpirit of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and therefore to drive it away they betake themſelves to their merry company, wine, ſtrong drink, and the like. This is all that many do care for the communion of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Some will ſay, but we deſire this communion more then ſo. It is well; but let all take heed of deceiving themſelves, as we are all apt to do. Let our deſire of this communion be proved rather then preſumed; and ſo I come to a ſecond uſe of the point, <hi>viz.</hi> for examination and triall.</p>

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:111827:178"/> object of our deſires or no: and let us try it thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Are we ſenſible of the want of the ſpirit? They that do not feel the want of a thing, will never deſire to enjoy it: When <hi>Eliſha</hi> deſired of <hi>Eliah,</hi> that he might have a double portion of his ſpirit, <hi>Thou haſt asked a hard thing</hi> (ſaid <hi>Eliah</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him) <hi>Nevertheleſſe if thou ſee me when I am taken from thee, it ſhall be ſo unto thee, but if not, it ſhall not be ſo,</hi> 2 King. 2. 10.

            <p n="2">2. Do we affect thoſe in whom is found the manifeſtation of the ſpirit? they that are carnall love thoſe that are carnall, and ſo will they that are ſpirituall love thoſe that are ſpirituall. This is a ſpeciall evidence of the holy Ghoſt dwelling in us, if we delight in thoſe in whom the gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt do appear and ſhine forth. <hi>David</hi> having much of Gods ſpirit in him, and deſiring ſtill more, calls the Saints <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> and profeſſeth that all his delight was in them, Pſal. 16. 3. And it is ſaid of <hi>Barnabas</hi> that when he came to Antioch, and had ſeen the grace of God, which was there beſtowed upon believers, <hi>he was glad, and exhorted them all, that that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And the reaſon follows immediately why
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:111827:179"/> he was thus affected, <hi>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 11. 23. 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Are we carefull to uſe the means whereby to obtain the ſpirit? It is but a fained and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deſire that doth not put forth it ſelf in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to obtain the thing deſired. Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend above others to magnifie the Spirit, and to be all for the ſpirit, yet vilifie the word, which is the means whereby to obtain the ſpirit. Surely the ſpirit which ſuch vaunt of, is none of Gods ſpirit, but their own ſpirit, not a ſpirit of illumination but of illuſion; not <hi>ſpiritus veritatis,</hi> the ſpirit of truth, but <hi>ſpiritus virtiginis,</hi> a ſpirit of giddineſſe,<note place="margin">Iſai. 19. 14.</note> or as we read it, a perverſe ſpirit: For God in his Covenant with his people, joyneth his ſpirit and his word together, <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>My ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhal not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>from henceforth and for ever,</hi> Iſai. 59. 21. And how did <hi>Cornelius</hi> and they that were with him receive the ſpirit, but by the word? <hi>While</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>yet ſpake theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word,</hi> Act. 10. 44. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> having ſaid, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately adds, <hi>Deſpiſe not prophecying,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 19. 20. Prayer alſo is a means whereby to obtain the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Indeed we muſt firſt have the ſpirit in ſome meaſure before we can pray to any purpoſe, as was ſhewed before: but prayer is a means to obtain the Spirit in greater meaſure. <hi>For God wil give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luk. 11. 13. They
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:111827:179"/> therefore who either reſtrain prayer before God, or pray only in formality or faſhion ſake, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it enough if they can read a prayer in a book, or ſay a prayer by rote, yea will ſcorn and deride praying by the ſpirit, theſe, I ſay, plainly ſhew how little they look after the communion of the holy Ghoſt. I am not againſt all uſe of book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer, or of a form of drayer, yet I may ſay to ſome in this reſpect, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that they are too ſuperſtitious.

            <p n="4">4. Do we ſtudy to bring forth the fruits of the Holy Ghoſt? <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit is in all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and righteouſneſſe, and truth,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 9. <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit is love, joy, peace, long ſuffering, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe, gooneſſe, faith, meekneſſe, temperance,</hi> Gal. 5. 22, 23. and v. 25. <hi>If we live in the ſpirit; let us walk in the ſpirit,</hi> that is, if we pretend to be indued with the ſpirit, let it appear by our ſpirituall life and converſation.</p>

When Jeſus beheld him, he ſaid, Thou art</hi> Simon <hi>the ſon of</hi> Jonas, <hi>thou ſhalt be called</hi> Cephas, <hi>which is by interpretation, a ſtone.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>[<hi>Will I build,</hi>] The Church is compared to a houſe, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5. therefore it is ſaid to be built, and Chriſt ſaith that he will build it, it being his houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. and ſo here he calls it his Church.</p>
            <p>[<hi>My Church,</hi>] It is called the <hi>Church of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. and ſo in other places, but here Chriſt calls it his Church: So <hi>Rom. 16. 16.

            <p>Our Engliſh vvord <hi>Church,</hi> is in ordinary ſpeech uſed for the place vvhere the people of God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble for the partaking of Gods Ordinances, but in the Scripture it is alvvaies uſed for the people. Some places there are, in which the word may ſeem to import the place, as 1 Cor. 11. 18. <hi>When ye come together in the Church,</hi> &amp; v. 22 <hi>Have ye not houſes to</hi>

               <note place="margin">What the <hi>Church</hi> is.</note> the Church may be thus defined, the Church is a company of perſons, whom God hath called out of the eſtate of ſin and miſery, unto the eſtate of grace and ſalvation thorough Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Ye are a choſen generation, a royall Prieſthood, a Holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a peculiar people, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath called you out of darkneſſe into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9.</p>

The Angells (I ſpeak of the good Angells) never were in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other eſtate then now they are in, though now they be more confirmed in that eſtate then they were at firſt, as appears by the fall of the evill Angells, <hi>who kept not their first eſtate,</hi> Jude v. 6. They never were in any eſtate of ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery out of which they ſhould be called. And for the Angels that ſinned, God ſpared not them, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. Again, the Angells are clearly diſtinguiſhed from the Church, <hi>Eph. 3. 10. To the intent that now unto the principalites and powers in heavenly places might be knowne by the Church the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, the Church thus taken for ſuch a<note place="margin">Of the Church militant, and the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</note> company of perſons, is divers wayes diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is the Church militant, and the Church triumphant: The Church militant is that company which is here upon earth in warfare, warring with Satan the world and the fleſh. The Church triumphant is that company which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vanquiſhed and overcome thoſe adverſaries, doth reign and triumph in heaven. This diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is grounded upon the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom the whole Family in heaven and earth is named,</hi> Eph. 3. 14, 15. And in other places ſometimes the Church militant, ſometimes the Church triumphant is hinted; <hi>Fight the good fight of faith,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> being a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:111827:184"/> of the Church militant, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 12. I have fought a good fight,</hi> ſaid he, when he was about to paſſe from the Church militant to the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 4. 7. So it is the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant that S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, ſaying, <hi>After this I beheld, and loe a great multitude, which no man could number, of all Nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues ſtood before the Throne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palmes in their hands,</hi> viz. in token of the victory that they had atchieved, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. But the Church militant is that which uſually is ſpoken of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>Yet in the Church I had rather ſpeak five words with mine understanding, that by my voice I might teach others alſo, then ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 19. And ſo in many other places.</p>
            <p>And the Church as here upon earth, conſiſts partly of ſuch as are indeed of it, partly of ſuch as onely in ſhew and profeſſion belong unto it; For <hi>all are not Iſrael, that are of Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 9. 6. that is, all are not indeed the people of God, who profeſſe themſelves to be of that number: No, ſome call themſelves Jewes, that is, Gods people, yet are not, but are the ſynagogue of Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. Onely true believers are indeed of the Church: For, <hi>if any one have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, the ſame is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. Prophane perſons and hypocrites are rather <hi>in the Church,</hi> then <hi>of the Church,</hi> like woodden leggs that are outwardly joyned to the body, yet are
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:111827:185"/> indeed no parts of the body; <hi>They went out from us but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 19. So ſpeaks <hi>S. John</hi> of ſome Apoſtates and back-ſliders, ſhewing that then when they profeſſed themſelves to be of the Church, yet indeed they were not of it.</p>
            <p>And hence is another diſtinction of the Church into the Church viſible, and the Church inviſible:<note place="margin">Of the Church viſible and the Church inviſible.</note> The viſible Church is a viſible company of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple profeſſing the Goſpell, whether they do it in truth and ſincerity or no; it doth conſiſt of good and bad, of elect and reprobate: It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>

The inviſible Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only of ſuch as are elect, and are indeed that which they profeſſe themſelves to be, like <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael, Iſraelites indeed, in whom is no guile,</hi> Joh. 1. 47. The Church in this reſpect is called invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, becauſe it is not viſible to the eyes of men; they can ſee the profeſſion, but whether it be ſincere and proceed from the heart or no, they cannot ſee. For <hi>God only knowes the hearts of all the children of men,</hi> 1 King. 8. 39. And ſo he only <hi>knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19.<note place="margin">Of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, and the Church u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Church is diſtinguiſhed into particular and univerſall: A particular Church is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſing the faith in ſome particular place. Thus we read of the <hi>ſeven Churches in Aſia,</hi>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:111827:185"/> Rev. 1. 4. that is, of Churches that were in ſeven Cities of Aſia, as it followes there v. 11. So we read <hi>of the Church that was at Antioch,</hi> Acts 13. 1. <hi>the Church which was at Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 8. 1. Yea, we read of Churches in particular houſes, as in the houſe of <hi>Aquila and Priſcilla,</hi> Rom. 16. 5. in the houſe of <hi>Nymphas,</hi> Col. 4. 15. in the houſe of <hi>Philemon,</hi> Philem. v. 2. The univerſall Church<note place="margin">This is the univerſall Church as upon earth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends both the Saints on earth, and the Saints in heaven.</note> is the whole company of believers throughout the world.

The univerſall Church is that which is mentioned in the Creed, and is called <hi>the Catholike Church;</hi> for Catholike is as much as generall or univerſall. The Church of Rome moſt abſurdly will be the Catholike Church, Roman Catholike is frequent in the mouths of Papiſts; but this is over-groſſe, Catholike importing the whole, and Roman but a part: The Church of Rome was once indeed an eminent part, yet but a part of the Catholike<note place="margin">

            <p>In the Creed the Church is ſtiled <hi>holy,</hi> and ſo it is: They that are indeed of the Church, are indeed holy; <hi>Ye are waſhed, ye are ſanctified,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>Wherefore holy brethren, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 3. 1. And they that are of the Church but by profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet by profeſſion are holy, <hi>Called to be Saints,</hi>

               <note place="margin">How the Church is ſtiled ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> 2 Tim. 2. 10. And though the viſible Church contain in it hypocrites and unholy perſons, as well as thoſe that are holy, yet the Church is called holy from the better part; even as a heap of wheat and chaffe being mixed together, we uſe to ſay of it, this is wheat, rather then this is chaffe, though there may be more of that then of the other.</p>
            <p>Now the Church which is ſo indeed, is holy two wayes:</p>

And this conſideration of the notes of the Church is very requiſite, and of great concernment: For as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat. 24. 23, 24.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:111827:188"/> This therefore I ſay, that although the Church of Rome can plead antiquity, yet this is not enough to prove it to be the true Church, this antiquity which it hath, being but a ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry antiquity. If they could evince that their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſimply and abſolutely moſt ancient, this were to ſome purpoſe: but this they can never do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But (ſay they) the Church of Rome was once a true and a ſound Church, by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> own teſtimony, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, but as the Prophet ſaies, <hi>How is the faithfull City become an Harlot?</hi> Iſai. 1. 21. So may I ſay, How is Rome degenerate, and quite chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from what it was in the Apoſtles time? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if the Apoſtle were now upon earth, he would never acknowledge the preſent Church of Rome, to be that, or any thing like that, which he did ſo much commend in his Epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. Did the Church of Rome then worſhip Images? did it pray to Saints? did it pray for the dead? did it perform divine worſhip in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue? did it withhold the Cup from people in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper? was the Church of Rome then in the Apoſtles time guilty of theſe and many other ſuch like errours and abſurdities, which are now maintained by the Romiſh Church?</p>
            <p>But our adverſaries think themſelves able to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any thing by the ſubtilty of their wit, and their ſtrength in arguing. They would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted inferiour unto thoſe, who would make make men believe, that ſnow is not white, nor
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:111827:188"/> that the heavens do move, and the earth ſtand ſtil, but that all is quite contrary to what vve imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> There is no change (ſay they) in the Church of Rome, but it is now the ſame in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it was in the Apoſtles daies. And to prove this, they ſay that in every change of Religion ſix<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Eccleſ. l. 4. c. 5.</note> things may be demonſtrated, 1. the authour of the change. 2. the new opinion brought in. 3. the time when. 4. the place where. 5. who oppoſed it. 6. the ſmal company by which the new opinion was firſt embraced. Now theſe circumſtances [they ſay] cannot be ſhewed concerning a change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Roman Church; and therefore [they conclude] there hath been no ſuch change in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But (ſay I) the change may be certain and evident, though theſe circumſtances be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and unknown; neither need we be ſolicitous about them. Chriſt did not think it requiſite to ſtand about theſe circumſtances, when he ſhewed how the Jewiſh Doctors had of a long time corrupted the true meaning of the Law, with their falſe gloſſes and interpretations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. So in the parable of the tares, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. there is no inquiry after theſe circumſtances, yet it plainly appeared that there were tares, and that was ſufficient, though theſe particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not known. And it is to be obſerved, that it is there ſaid, that while men ſlept the tares were<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 25.</note> ſown. Errours often creep in ſecretly, when men are not aware, becauſe they do not watch and ſeek to prevent them as they ſhould do. And An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Doctrine eſpecially is called <hi>a myſtery.</hi>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:111827:189"/> 2 Theſ. 2. 7. it came in ſlily under a colour of piety, and ſo was not at firſt ſo eaſie to be diſcerned. Some of the Papiſts themſelves are forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that great and notable change there hath been, and yet they cannot tell when it firſt began, nor by whom, and the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſſander</hi> confeſſeth that in the Roman Church,<note place="margin">Caſſand. Conſult. art. 22.</note> for above a thouſand years after Chriſt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper was adminiſtred in both kinds (ſo that people received both the bread and the cup) now we know it is otherwiſe, though the firſt introduction of this change cannot be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So for private Maſſes (as they call them) that is, ſuch as wherein the Prieſt alone doth receive the Sacrament, the people being by, and looking on, but not communicating with him: the ſame Authour cites another <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> viz. <hi>Hoffmeſter,</hi> ſaying, that the thing it ſelf doth ſhew, that both in the Greek and Latin Church, the people did uſe to communicate with the Prieſt, and that it is a<note place="margin">Res ipſa clamat, &amp; quodqitomodo ceſſaverit, mirandum eſt, &amp; ut bonus ille uſus in Eccleſiam revo cetur, laborandum. Hoffmeſt. apud Caſſand. Conſult. de miſſ. Solitar.</note> wonder how this cuſtome ceaſed, and to be indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it may be reſtored. Yet concerning many erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinions and practices of the Church of Rome, our Divines have by records and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of antiquity ſhewed, who firſt brought them in, and when they did it, as alſo who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But this ſufficeth to convince them of novelty, that we can eaſily make it appear that (as Chriſt ſaid concerning the matter of divorce as uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:111827:189"/> the Jews) <hi>from the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> Mat. 19. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But however our Adverſaries think to lay us flat on the ground, and to ſtrike us dead by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truly this is as idle and ridiculous a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, as if a Maſſe of gold having contracted much droſſe, and after being purged, one ſhould ask Where was that gold before it was purged? Or as if a body having been ful of ſores and diſeaſes, and after being made whole, one ſhould ask, Where was that body before it was made whole? <hi>Luther</hi> and others whom God ſtirred up and made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental and ſubſervient unto him in that kind, did not erect a new Church, but reform the old. As it is the ſame gold now as before, but more pure, and the ſame body, but more ſound; ſo it is the ſame Church, but reformed. The Papacy dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the Church, as the droſſe from the gold, and the botch from the body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> And hence alſo that captious queſtion of our adverſaries is eaſie to be anſwered, What is become of your Fore-fathers, who lived and died before <hi>Luther?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our Fore-fathers we hope well of, they might live and die in the Church of Rome, and yet be free from many errours that are in it. Even now ſince the Councell of Trent ſome on their death beds, at leaſt, are found to renounce that grand point of Popery concerning Juſtification, diſclaiming all confidence in their own inherent righteouſneſſe, and flying wholly to the mercy of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:111827:190"/> God in Chriſt Jeſus, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and contentious diſpute againſt it, confeſſeth<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Much more (may we well ſuppoſe) before the Councell of Trent, when people were more free, the doctrines and practices of the Church of Rome, being not ſo eſtabliſhed as afterwards, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this and other points did keep themſelves pure. Beſides, errours and corruptions being now more clearly and fully diſcovered then before, it is not ſafe now to continue in the Communion of that Church, though God might graciouſly paſſe by and pardon the ignorance and weakneſſe of our Fore-fathers. It is now clear as the Sun at noon day, that the Church of Rome is that Babylon, concerning vvhich the precept is expreſſe, <hi>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues,</hi> Revel. 18. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another note of the Church, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts<note place="margin">2. Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> aſſign, is ſucceſſion of Paſtours and Teachers, they can ſhevv ſuch a ſucceſſion, and thence they conclude that they are the true Church. But there is a twofold ſucceſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> perſonall and doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, a ſucceſſion of perſons, and a ſucceſſion of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:111827:190"/> Doctrine; the former vvithout the latter is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The Prieſts that condemned Chriſt had a perſonall ſucceſſion, but vvanted doctrinall ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They could ſhew hovv their perſons did ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe that vvere before them, and they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſo on untill they came to <hi>Aaron;</hi> but they could not ſhevv the like ſucceſſion of their doctrine: ſo neither can the Papiſts ſhevv that they hold the ſame faith, vvhich vvas delivered by the Apoſtles, and therefore in vain do they vaunt of this, that they can ſhevv a perſonall ſucceſſion of their Popes from the times of the Apoſtles. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarm. de. Eccleſ. l. 4. c. 8.</note> confeſſeth that the argument drawn from ſucceſſion doth not hold for the affirmative, <hi>viz.</hi> that vvhere there is ſucceſſion, there is the true Church, but only negatively, that there is not the Church, where ſucceſſion is wanting. So then by their own confeſſion this argument makes little for them, and as little doth it make againſt us. For though our Divines have laboured not unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to ſhew that ſucceſſively in all ages there have been ſome or other who have aſſerted the truth which we maintain, this is ſufficient, that we can make it appear, that we hold the ſame faith, <hi>which was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and have not<note place="margin">Iude v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This alſo I willingly grant, that ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons ought to be admoniſhed and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and if the caſe ſo require, excommunicated and caſt out of the Church untill they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves penitent; <hi>Warne them that are unruly,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 14. <hi>If any obey not our word by this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 14. <hi>Put away from among your ſelves that wicked perſon,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 13. <hi>Sufficient to ſuch a man is this puniſhment, which was inflicted of many, 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 6. But all this notwithſtanding, it followes not that it is no true Church, wherewith it is lawfull to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, if ſuch Diſcipline either be not eſtabliſhed, or not executed in it, but ſuch are tolerated as are not meet to be members of it. For we find that in all times the Church hath been ſo infected and polluted, as to have corrupt and rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, not only cloſe hypocrites, but alſo openly
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:111827:194"/> profane perſons, yet did it not therefore preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſe to be a Church, from which the godly were not to make a ſeparation, although they ought to keep themſelves pure from contagion, and in their places and callings to indeavour the reformation of what was amiſſe in it. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to all the Congregation of Iſrael, ſaid, <hi>Thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God,</hi> Deut. 7. 6. So they all were by profeſſion, but many of them were far from being ſo indeed. And that <hi>Moſes</hi> knew very well, he had frequent and manifeſt proof of it. He ſaw how upon every occaſion they were murmuring and provoking God, and how when he was but a while abſent from them, they fell to open idolatry. As in divers other places, ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. he dealt plainly with them, and told them of their wickedneſſe: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand therefore</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to poſſeſſe it for thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; for thou art a ſtiffe-necked people.

Jeh. 9. 2, 3. Infinite of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:111827:194"/> ſuch like paſſages there are in the writings of the Prophets; yet did they not therefore deny the Jewiſh Church to be a true Church, to which all ought to joyn, they did neither make themſelves, nor exhort others to make ſeparation from it: So in our Saviours time the Evangelicall ſtory ſhewes how exceeding corrupt it was, yet ſtill Jeruſalem is termed the <hi>holy City,</hi> Mat. 4. 5. <hi>the City of the great King,</hi> Mat. 5. 35.

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer: It is true, the light being now more clear, and the means of grace more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, we ought to be more holy; <hi>For unto whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> Luk. 12. 48. But nevertheleſſe the writings of the Apoſtles ſhew that even Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in their times were not free from groſſe and ſcandalous offenders, and yet they were ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Churches, neither were any required to ſeparate from them: <hi>It hath been declared unto me of you my brethren, by them which are of the houſe of Cloe, that there are contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you: Now this I ſay, that every one of you
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:111827:195"/> ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I am of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I am of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I am of Christ, 1 Cor. 1. 11, 12. Ye are carnall; for whereas there are among you envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſtrife, and diviſions, are ye not carnall, and walk as men? 1 Cor. 3. 3. Now in this that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you, I praiſe you not, that you come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not for the better, but for the worſe. For first of all, when ye come together in the Church, I hear that there be diviſions among you, and I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe it: For there muſt alſo be hereſies among you, that they which are approved may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper; for in eating every one taketh before other his own ſupper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken: What have you not houſes to eat and drink in? Or, deſpiſe ye the Church of God, and ſhame them that have not? What ſhall I ſay unto you? ſhall I praiſe you in this? I praiſe you not,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>How ſay ſome among you, that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead?</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 12. <hi>I feare leſt when I come I ſhall not find you ſuch as I would, and that I ſhall be found unto you ſuch as ye would not, leſt there be debates, envyings, wraths, ſtrifes, backbitings, whiſperings, ſwellings, tumults; and leſt when I come again, my God will humble me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and that I ſhall bewail many which have ſinned already, and have not repented of the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and fornication, and laſciviouſneſſe which they have committed,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 20, 21. By theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we may ſee how farre from that purity and holineſſe that was requiſite, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, and yet the Apoſtle ſtiled them <hi>the Church of God,</hi>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:111827:195"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. and bleſſed God for them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. ſo far was he from admoniſhing any to ſeparate from them, notwithſtanding the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and diſorders that were among them. So it appears by the ſecond and third Chapters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> how corrupt and unſound the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> there ſpoken of, were both in doctrine and manners, yet ſtill Chriſt accounted them Churches, and only exhorted them to repent and amend, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe threatning to powre his wrath upon them, he never taxed any for abiding in them, ſo that they did not joyn in thoſe corruptions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some may object that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But it was not the Apoſtles meaning, that Chriſtians ſhould ſeparate from a Church; wherein are found wicked perſons, as if it were not lawfull to joyn with ſuch in the uſe of Gods Ordinances, for then we ſhould not know where to find a Church upon earth to joyn our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the whole ſeries and tenour both of the old and new Teſtament is againſt ſuch ſeparation: but the meaning is, that Chriſtians muſt ſeparate from all wicked ones ſo as not to joyn with them in their wickedneſſe. So immediately there it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>touch not the unclean</hi> thing, that is, do not joyn with others in their pollutions. So Epheſ. 5. 6, 7. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words, for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience. Be ye not therfore partakers with them,</hi> viz. in thoſe things, for which the wrath of God cometh upon them. &amp; v. 11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:111827:196"/> with the unfruitfull works of darkneſs, but reprove them rather.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then by Scripture the caſe is clear, that ſuch holineſſe of Church-members as ſome ſtand upon, is not eſſentiall to the Church, nor any neceſſary mark of it. And in this all our famous Proteſtant Divines (that I know) agree. I will only cite one, who for his worth and excellency may be in ſtead of all, viz. <hi>Calvin. the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſay, that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anabaptiſtae aiunt, ubicunque ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li non excluduntur à communione, illic Chriſtianum communicando ſeſe polluere. Nos è contrà dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Chriſtianum maestitia affici debere, cum ſacroſanctam caenam pollui videt ab iniquis &amp; impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, qui ad eam admittuntur, &amp; curare quantum in ipſo eſt, ne id fiat, quod ſi fiat ipſi tamen ſeſe privare caenâ, &amp; à communione ſubducere non licere; debere potius in eo perſiſtere, ut quamdiu in eo loco agit, cum caeteris Deum adoret, verbum audiat, caenamque recipiat. <hi>Calvin. Inſtruct. adverſ. Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt. vide Ibid.</hi> plura.</note> 
               <hi>whereſoever evill perſons are not excluded from communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there a Chriſtian doth pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute himſelf, if he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. We on the otherſide ſay, that a Christian ought to be grieved, when he ſees the Holy Supper polluted by the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that are admitted unto it; and that he ought to indeavor what he can, that it may not be ſo polluted. But if it be, yet he may not deprive himſelf of the Sacrament, and withdraw himſelf from communion, but must rather perſiſt in this reſolution, ſo long as he abides there, together with others, to worſhip God, hear the word, and receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi> Much more he hath to this purpoſe, alledging many places both of the old and new Teſtament for proof of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another note of the Church which ſome<note place="margin">2. Church Covenant.</note> much ſtand upon, is a Church-Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> an expreſſe Covenant, which all the members of the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:111827:196"/> Church muſt enter into, whereby they expreſſely and formally bind themſelves to the performing ſuch duties as they conceive to be required of them. This ſome make ſo neceſſary, as if there could be no true and rightly conſtituted viſible Church without it. They will not admit any to the Lords Table, though they cannot but judge them ſuch as have reall union and communion with Chriſt, neither will they admit their children to Baptiſm, except it appear that by ſuch a Covenant they are in Church-fellowſhip, or members of a Church, that is, gathered together by ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. But ſo far as I can ſee, the Scripture no where ſhews us, that ſuch a Covenant is requiſite. I grant, that in ſome caſe, upon ſpeciall occaſion it may be meet for the members of a Church to Covenant together about thoſe things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, <hi>viz.</hi> for the reforming, or preſerving of the Church from groſſe corruptions that have got, or are likely to get into it. Thus <hi>Aſa</hi> and the people of Judah entred into a Covenant, as we read, 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 15. But ordinarily ſuch a Covenant is not neceſſary. We read of many Churches plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apoſtles, yet of no ſuch Covenant: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find that the members of the Church were admitted into it by Baptiſm, by which all do ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Covenant one with another. <hi>Then they that gladly received the word, were baptized, and the ſame day there were added unto them about three thouſand ſouls. And they continued ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread and prayers,</hi> Act. 2. 41, 42. <hi>For by one ſpirit are we all baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. <hi>There is
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:111827:197"/> one body, and one ſpirit, &amp;c. one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Having hitherto ſpoken of thoſe notes of the<note place="margin">True notes of the Church.</note> Church, which the Papiſts and others do errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſign, I come now to the true notes of it, and they are theſe.</p>

The word is that whereby the members of the Church are nouriſhed. <hi>As new born babes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Teachers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11. 12. <hi>And now bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 20. 32.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The miniſtery of the word being taken away, the Church ceaſeth. <hi>I will remove thy candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent,</hi> Revel. 2. 5. As if he ſhould ſay, I will diſchurch thee, I will make thee ceaſe to be a Church, <hi>viz.</hi> by taking away the word and miniſtry. For in that reſpect Churches are called candleſticks, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 20. becauſe they
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:111827:197"/> hold forth the light of Gods word by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and diſpenſation of it.</p>
            <p>A falſe and corrupt Church is known by falſe and corrupt doctrine. Therefore on the other ſide a true and ſound Church is known by true and ſound doctrine. True it is, falſe doctrine may get into a true Church, and through the prevalency of falſe teachers may bear ſway in it; but if it come to prevail ſo far, as that all muſt either ſubſcribe to it (as in the Church of Rome) or els they can have no communion with it, then it ceaſeth to be a true Church, I mean, ſuch as wherein it is lawfull to abide, but there is a neceſſity of making ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it: <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 18. 4. and ſo far forth as any Church is infected with falſe doctrine, ſo far forth it degenerateth into a falſe Church. <hi>I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that you are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpell,</hi> Gal. 1. 6. <hi>I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed on you labour in vain,</hi> Gal. 4. 11. the Apoſtle feared leaſt by that corruption of doctrine that was in the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> they would quite be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and come to nothing. And Chriſt ſpeaking to the Angell (or Paſtor) of the Church in Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, in the name of the whole Church, ſaith thus: <hi>But I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt there them that hold the doctrine of</hi> Balaam, <hi>who taught</hi> Balak <hi>to caſt a ſtumbling block before the children of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed unto Idols, and to commit fornication. So haſt thou alſo them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. Repent, or els I will come unto thee quickly,</hi> &amp;c. Revel. 2. 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <pb n="384" facs="tcp:111827:198"/>
            <p>2. Another true note of the Church, is, The<note place="margin">2. The right ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> right adminiſtration of the Sacraments: When Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles to gather his Church, he commanded them, as to preach, ſo alſo to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; Mat. 28. 19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> That of the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 17. Christ ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel,</hi> is not to be taken ſimply and abſolutely, that the Apoſtle was not at all ſent to baptize; for, no doubt he had the ſame Commiſſion as the other Apoſtles had: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he there teſtifieth, that he did baptize ſome, though not many, v. 14. &amp; 16. whereas if Chriſt had not ſent him to baptize, he might not have baptized any. It is therefore ſpoken compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, like that, <hi>Receive inſtruction, and not ſilver,</hi> Prov. 8. 10. that is, rather then ſilver: and that, <hi>I deſired mercy, and not ſacrifice,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 6. that is, rather then ſacrifice: So here <hi>Christ ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpell,</hi> that is, not ſo much to baptize as to preach the Goſpell. But though in that Commiſſion <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. onely Baptiſme is expreſſed as being the Sacrament of initiation, that whereby we ſolemnly enter into the Church, yet there is alſo the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which is to be adminiſtred in, and celebrated by the Church: See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. &amp;c. Theſe Sacraments as they are ſeals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God hath made with his Church, ſo are they badges and cognizances whereby the Church is knowne and diſcerned; <hi>For by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:111827:198"/> Jewes or Gentiles, whether bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. As theſe Sacraments are more or leſſe purely adminiſtred, ſo the Church is more or leſſe pure.</p>
            <p>3. A mutuall connexion and due order of<note place="margin">3. A mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and due order of the parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church.</note> the parts and members of the Church, this is alſo a note and mark of it: As in a naturall body the parts and members are united together, and fitly ordered: ſo is it in the myſticall body, the Church.</p>
            <p>1. There muſt be union and connexion of the parts and members: <hi>Let us not forſake the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is.</hi> Heb. 10. 25. <hi>Mark thoſe that cauſe diviſions, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 16. 17.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, there muſt alſo be order, a due order and diſpoſition of the parts, ſome to teach and govern, ſome to be taught and governed; <hi>Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 29. Not all, but ſome; <hi>He gave ſome Apostles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Pastors and Teachers,</hi> Eph. 4. 11. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 20. 28. <hi>And we beſeech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 12. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 13. 1.</p>
            <p>Some may take in Diſcipline as a note of the Church, but I thinke it not properly a note of it, becauſe it is not of the being, but only of the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:111827:199"/> well-being of the Church: As a hedge or wall is to a garden, ſo is Diſcipline to the Church; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and needfull is it for the preſervation of the Church in purity both of Doctrine and Manners, and where it is long wanting the Church will be apt to grow very corrupt, yet it is not of ſuch neceſſity, but that the Church may ſubſiſt without it; neither may we for want of Diſcipline conclude that it is no Church, or not ſuch as wherin we may continue, but muſt needs ſeparate from it: For in our Saviours time what Diſcipline was in the Jewiſh Church, whenas they that confeſſed him were caſt out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue? <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 22. &amp; 34.</p>

            <p>HAving treated ſufficiently of the name and nature, the diſtinctions and notes of the Church, I come to the point, which theſe words [<hi>

            <p>The ſtrength and ſtability of the Church may yet further appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Gods promiſes made unto it; <hi>I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment, leſt any hurt it I will keep it night and day,</hi> Eſa. 27. 3. <hi>No weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper, and every tongue that ſhall riſe against thee in judgment, ſhalt thou condemn,</hi> Eſa. 54. 17. <hi>For I, ſaith the Lord, will be a wall of fire round about her, and will be the glory in the midſt of her,</hi> Zach. 2. 5. In ſuch places of Scripture as wherein God
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:111827:200"/> doth threaten to afflict and puniſh his Church, yet ſtill he mitigates the ſharpneſſe of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with ſweet promiſes, that he will not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy it, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 10. 6. God ſaith that he would ſend the Aſſyrian againſt an hypocriticall Nation, and againſt the people of his wrath, (ſo he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Jewiſh Nation and people, which was then his Church) and would give him a charge to take the ſpoile, and to take the prey, and to tread them downe like the mire of the ſtreets. But leſt any ſhould think that the Church ſhould quite be deſtroyed, it follovves v. 20. &amp; 21. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the remnant of Iſrael and ſuch as are eſcaped of the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſhall no more again ſtay upon him that ſmote them, but ſhall ſtay upon the Lord, the holy one of Iſrael, in truth: The remnant ſhall return, even the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of</hi> Jacob <hi>unto the mighty God.</hi> And againe, v. 24. &amp; 25. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts, O my people that dwelleſt in Sion, be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Aſſyrian; he ſhall ſmite thee with the rod, and ſhall lift up his ſtaffe against thee after the manner of Aegypt: For yet a very little while, and the indignation ſhall ceaſe, and mine anger in their deſtruction.</hi> Though God be provoked againſt his Church, and ſmite it ſore, yet his anger ſhall ceaſe in the deſtruction, not of his Church, but of the adverſaries of it: So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 17. 4. the Lord threatneth, ſaying, <hi>And in that day it ſhall come to paſſe, that the glory of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall be made thin, and the fatneſſe of his fleſh ſhall wax lean;</hi> but v. 6. he addes, <hi>Yet gleaning grapes ſhall be left in it, as the ſhaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the

Having ſaid that there ſhould be deſolation and deſtruction, to ſhew that yet this ſhould not be utter deſolation, and utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the like promiſe is annexed. <hi>When thus it ſhall be in the midſt of the Land among the people, there ſhall be as the ſhaking of an Olivetree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done,</hi> So Jer. 3. 14. <hi>Turn, O back-ſliding children, ſaith the Lord, for I am married unto you, and I wil take you one of a City, and two of a Family, and I wil bring you to Sion,</hi> &amp; Jer. 46. 28. <hi>Fear not thou, ô Iacob my ſervant, ſaith the Lord; for I am with thee, for I wil make a ful end of all the Nations whither I have driven thee, but</hi>

The Lord having before threatned to inflict ſore plagues and puniſhments, adds, <hi>Yet wil I leave a remnant, that you may have ſome that ſhall eſcape the ſword among the Nations, when ye ſhall be ſcattered thorough the Countries,</hi> And Ezek. 14. 22. Although he threatned to ſend his four ſore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Jeruſalem, the ſword, and the famin, and the noiſom beaſt, and the peſtilence, to cut off from it man and beaſt, <hi>Yet behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>therein ſhall be left a remnant that ſhall be brought forth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus Gods promiſes to his Church ſhew that no adverſe power ſhall prevail againſt it, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as utterly to overthrow it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame alſo may appear by Gods providence towards it: as he hath promiſed, ſo he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:111827:201"/> as the ſtory of the Church in all ages doth make manifeſt. <hi>He hath remembred his Covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thouſand generations. Which Covenant he made with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>and his Oath unto</hi> Iſaac: <hi>And confirmed the ſame unto</hi> Jacob <hi>for a Law, and to</hi> Iſrael <hi>for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant, ſaying, unto thee will I give the Land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance. When they were but few men in number, yea very few, and ſtrangers in it. When they went from one Nation to another, from one Kingdome to another people; He ſuffered no man to do them wrong, but reproved Kings for their ſakes, ſaying, Touch not mine anointed, &amp; do my Prophets no harm,</hi> Pſal. 105. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>The Church hath been much and often perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by her adverſaries, yet it hath been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; maugre all their malice &amp; fury againſt it, they were not able to deſtroy it. <hi>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may</hi> Iſrael <hi>now ſay; many time have they afflicted me from my youth, but they have not prevailed againſt me: the plowers plowed upon my back, &amp; made long their furrows. The Lord is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, he hath cut aſunder the coards of the wicked,</hi> Pſal. 129. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the Egyptians did wickedly conſpire againſt the people of God, and did cruelly oppreſſe them, yet could they not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt them.

            <p n="1">1. God is able to preſerve the Church: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle argueth from Gods power, and thence proveth the ſtability of a particular member of the Church, though a weak member. <hi>Yea, he ſhal be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den up, for God is able to make him ſtand,</hi> So our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from hence likewiſe ſheweth the certainty of the perſeverance &amp; ſalvation of the whole Church, and all the members of it. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.

            <p n="2">2. God will preſerve his Church, and that in divers reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the relation that is betwixt him and the Church. It is his Church. So Chriſt who is God bleſſed for ever, Rom. 9. 5. calls it in the Text, <hi>my Church,</hi> and 1 Tim. 3. 15. it is called <hi>the Church of the living God.</hi> In the ſame place it is called, <hi>the houſe of God.</hi> And Pſal. 48. 8. and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, <hi>the City of God.</hi> It is his Spouſe <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11. his Body, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 27.

               </label> ſhall inſiſt on, is this: That the Saints have communion and fellowſhip with God, and with Jeſus Chriſt, and with one another.</p>
            <p>By Saints are meant holy men and women, true and reall members of the Church: As for Angells, though they be holy, as they are ſtiled, <hi>the holy Angells,</hi> Mat. 25. 31. And Jude v. 14. by <hi>Saints</hi> ſeem to be meant thoſe ſame holy Angells; yet (as hath been ſhewed before) the Angells are
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:111827:208"/> not properly of the Church, and ſo not of the Saints now ſpoken of, which conſiſt onely of men and women.</p>
            <p>And theſe Saints are partly in heaven, where they are perfect and compleat Saints, ſo holy as to be <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 27. there are <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12. 23. Partly upon earth, where there are true Saints, though incompleat and imperfect, ſuch as have ſtill ſin and corruption remaining in them: <hi>For there is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 20. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 8. Some are ſo ſimple as to think that there are no Saints but in heaven, when as the Scripture ſpeaks expreſly of <hi>the Saints that are upon the earth,</hi> Pſal. 16. 3. And u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually where Saints are mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Saints on earth are meant: As Pſal. 34. 9. <hi>O fear the Lord all ye his Saints; for there is no lack to them that fear him.</hi> And Pſal. 79. 2. <hi>The fleſh of thy Saints</hi> [have they given] <hi>to the beaſts of the earth.</hi> And Prov. 2. 8. <hi>He preſerveth the way of his Saints.</hi> And 2 Cor. 13. 13. <hi>All the Saints ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you.</hi> And Phil. 4. 22. <hi>All the Saints ſalute you, chiefly they that are of</hi> Caeſars <hi>houſhold.</hi> So in many other places: Now when we ſpeak of the Communion of Saints, both the Saints in heaven, and the Saints on earth are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; both the one and the other have the communion here ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> with God, and with Chriſt, and with one another.</p>
            <p>Now the ground of communion is union;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:111827:208"/> firſt therefore, the Saints have union with God, and with Chriſt, and with one another, and then they have communion with God, and with Chriſt, and with one another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With God: The Saints in heaven have perfect union with God, and ſo perfect commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. They have a clear ſight of God, they ſee him not (as here) <hi>through a glaſſe, darkly, but face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. And they have a full fruition of God: <hi>In his preſence they have fulneſſe of joy, and at his right hand they have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16. 11. So they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly ſounding forth <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> they are continually exerciſed in praiſing and magnifying God; <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, they will be ſtill praiſing thee.</hi> Pſal. 84. 4. This is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially true of thoſe that dwell in Gods upper houſe, in heaven.</p>
            <p>The Saints on earth alſo have union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, though not in that perfect manner as they in heaven: The Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have union with God by ſight, the Saints on earth have only union with God by faith; <hi>For we walk by faith, and not by ſight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 7. And ſo the Saints on earth have communion with God by exerciſing their faith, and ſhewing forth the fruits of it; by praiſing God, and praying unto him, and performing ſuch acts of worſhip and ſervice as he requires of them. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but of one act of communion which the Saints here have with God, how doth he admire the excellency of it? <hi>For what Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the

And in reſpect of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they have with God in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his Ordinances and injunctions, he add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

David</hi> alſo ſpeaking of communion with God in his Sanctuary and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which the Saints on earth have, cries out, <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hoſts! My ſoule longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord, my heart and my fleſh crieth out for the living God,</hi> Pſal. 84. 1, 2. So Pſal. 42. 1. 2. Moſt affectionately he expreſſeth his deſire to injoy this communion with God, <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee O God: My ſoule thirſteth for God, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, when ſhall I come and appear before God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. With Chriſt: the Saints in heaven have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect union and communion with him. <hi>Father I will that they whom thou haſt given me, be where I am, that they may behold my glory,</hi> Joh. 17. 24. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a deſire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better,</hi> Phil. 1. 23.

            <p n="3">3. With one another. The Saints, both they in heaven, and they on earth, are all united together in one myſticall body, whereof Chriſt is Head. For it pleaſed God, <hi>to gather together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 10. They are all knit together by one and the ſame ſpirit. <hi>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentils, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. The Apoſtle there ſpeaks of baptizing and drinking, becauſe the Sacraments, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, are outward tokens and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the union of the Saints, as they are here upon earth; but ſtill he mentions the ſpirit, as that whereby the union is indeed wrought. And as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo communion which flows from union. For as it is in the naturall body, ſo is it alſo in the myſticall, the members being united one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have communion one with another, becauſe as the members of the naturall body partake all
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:111827:210"/> of one ſoul, ſo the members of the myſtical body partake all of one ſpirit. Becauſe the Saints have <hi>the communion of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 14. <hi>the fellowſhip of the ſpirit,</hi> Phil. 2. 1. therefore they have communion and fellowſhip one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>Now the Saints being ſome in heaven, and ſome on earth, there ariſeth a fourfold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or fellowſhip which the Saints have one with another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a communion which the Saints in heaven have one with another. They certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce one in anothers happineſſe, and praiſe God one for an other. Here men, and even ſometimes good men, through the corruption that is in them, envy one another, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> did <hi>Moſes,</hi> Num. 12. 1. But the Saints in heaven are wholly free from this diſtemper, they are made perfect in love and charity, which envieth not, 1 Cor. 13. 4. <hi>rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth,</hi> v. 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a communion, which the Saints in heaven have with the Saints on earth. They wiſh them that happineſſe which themſelves have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, and in generall (as we may conceive) pray for them. For though they be not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the particular eſtate of the Saints here below, yet in generall they know that as they in heaven are triumphant, ſo their fellow-members on earth are militant, and therefore charity (as the Apoſtle ſaith) never failing, they have a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 8.</note> of their caſe (ſo far forth as is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with their own happineſſe) and a care for them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:111827:210"/>3. There is a communion which the Saints on earth have with the Saints in heaven. They rejoyce in their happineſſe, praiſe God for them, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their faith and converſation, that ſo they alſo may partake of the ſame happineſſe with them. Thus far forth the Scripture doth warrant our Communion with the Saints in heaven. <hi>For the memory of the juſt is bleſſed,</hi> Prov. 10. 7. <hi>All gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſhall call me bleſſed</hi> ſaid the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Luk. 1. 48. And the Apoſtle bids, <hi>Be followers of thoſe, who through faith and patience inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> Heb. 6. 12. But for praying to the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, as they of the Church of Rome teach, we have no Scripture to countenance any ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but it is quite diſſonant and repugnant to Scripture. God is he, to whom we muſt pray, <hi>Call upon me,</hi> Pſal. 50. 15. <hi>As for me I will call upon God,</hi> Pſal. 55. 16. <hi>For this ſhall every one that is godly pray unto thee,</hi> Pſal. 32. 6. <hi>After this manner therefore pray ye, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 6. 9. Neither muſt we pray in the name of any but of Chriſt only. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, the man Christ Ieſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. Beſides, the Saints departed do not underſtand our particular affairs. When a man is dead he is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the eſtate of ſuch as had moſt near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto him. <hi>His ſons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it not of them,</hi> Job. 14. 21.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a Communion which the Saints on earth have one with another; &amp; this is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, which the Scripture chiefly ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of. <hi>They are kindly affectioned one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:111827:211"/> Rom. 12. 10. <hi>They rejoyce with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and weep with them that weep, v. 15. They have the ſame care one for another; If one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; if one member be honoured, they all rejoyce with it,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 25, 26. <hi>They bear one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> Gal. 6. 2. <hi>As every one hath received the gift, ſo they minister the ſame one to another, as good ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the manifest grace of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 10.</p>
            <p>More particularly the Saints on earth have communion one with another. 1. in reſpect of ſpirituall things; they joyn together in the uſe of Gods Ordinances. Thus it is ſaid of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, that <hi>they continued ſtedfastly in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers,</hi> Act. 2. 42. And v. 46. that <hi>they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, &amp;c.</hi> And the Apoſtle exhorts ſaying, <hi>And let us conſider one another, &amp;c. Not forſaking the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is,</hi> Heb. 10. 24, 25. According to their places and callings they teach and admoniſh one another, Col. 3. 16. They exhort one another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. &amp; 10. 25. They comfort and edifie one another, 1 Theſ. 4. 18. &amp; 5. 11. They pray one for another, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 18. Jam.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
            <p>2. In reſpect of temporall things; they ſuccour and relieve one another. It is recorded of the Saints in the Apoſtles time, that <hi>they had all things common, and ſold their poſſeſſions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need,</hi> Act. 2. 44, 45. So Act. 4. 32. <hi>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one ſoul, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:111827:211"/> ſaid any of them, that ought of the things that he poſſeſſed wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his own, but they had all things common,</hi> &amp;v. 34. &amp; 35. <hi>For as many as were poſſeſſors of lands or houſes, ſold them, and brought the prices of the things that were ſold, and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet, and distribution was made unto every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had need.</hi> This example of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Saints, the Anabaptiſts before theſe times have abuſed, inferring from thence that <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> all propriety of goods ought to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from among Chriſtians, and that all things ſhould be ſo common among them, that none ſhould have right to any thing more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But this is over-groſſe. For 1. What was done by a few living together in one City, cannot conveniently be done by all throughout the vvorld. Neither then in the Apoſtles time was that communion injoyned, none was required to part with the intereſt that he had in any thing, as is clear by that of <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias, Whiles it remained, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This ſhewes that, <hi>Anamas</hi> might have choſen whether he would fell his poſſeſſion or no; and when he had ſold it, whether he would bring the money, that he had for it, to the Apoſtles or no. But thus far that example is to be followed, that they which have, muſt communicate to thoſe that want. <hi>To do good, and to communicate forget not,</hi> Heb. 13. 16. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, &amp;c. That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17, 18. <hi>As we have opportunity let us do good unto all, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:111827:212"/> unto them that are of the houſhold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 10.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. The uſe of this doctrine is, firſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and reprove ſuch as profeſſe themſelves Chriſtians, and ſo conſequently Saints, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>et do little regard the communion of Saints, that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all true Saints have, with God, with Chriſt, and with one another. In ſtead of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, ſome have communion with Satan, in ſtead of communion with Chriſt, they have communion with <hi>Belial,</hi> with fin and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, in ſtead of communion with Saints, they have communion with the ungodly; in ſtead of joyning in the worſhip and ſervice of God, they joyn in the practice of iniquity, ſwearing and ſwaggering, drinking and revelling together, and this they account and call good-fellowſhip, but it is far from that fellowſhip which the Text doth ſpeak of, which indeed is the only true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowſhip. <hi>God is light</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Iohn</hi> preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Text) <hi>and in him is no darkneſſe at all. If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſſe, we lie, and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Be ye not une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually yoked together with unbelievers, for what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with unrighteouſneſſe? and what communion hath light with darkneſſe? And what concord hath Christ with</hi> Belial? <hi>or what part hath he that believeth, with an Infidel? And what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Some under a pretence of ſanctity violate the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:111827:212"/> communion of Saints; they forſake the aſſemblies of the Saints, becauſe of ſome in thoſe aſſemblies by whoſe ſociety they fear to be polluted: but this is either great hypocriſie, or a groſſe errour. <hi>Let a man examin himſelf,</hi> (ſaid the Apoſtle) <hi>and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 28. Therefore it is not the unworthineſſe of others that can prejudice thee, if thou thy ſelf beeſt not unworthy. <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate;</hi> how? <hi>and touch not the unclean thing,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 17. So ſeparate, as to have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with others in that which is evill. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſſe, but reprove them rather,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 11.</p>
            <p>Some will exerciſe communion of Saints in reſpect of ſpiritual things, but in reſpect of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things they wil have no ſuch communion. The Hebrew Doctors note that there are four ſorts of perſons;</p>

And Chriſt after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection told his Apoſtles, that they and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters <hi>ſhould preach remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Luk. 24. 47. <hi>Be it knowne unto you</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul) that through this man</hi> (viz. Chriſt) <hi>is preached unto you forgiveneſse of ſins,</hi> Acts 13. 38. That the Apoſtles did otherwiſe then thus forgive ſins we find not.

            <p n="2">2. For whoſe ſake ſins are forgiven. <hi>viz.</hi> For Chriſts ſake: He commanded that <hi>remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations,</hi> Luke 24. 47. So <hi>Paul</hi> told them to whom he preached, ſaying, <hi>thorough this man is preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you for giveneſſe of ſins; And by him all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes, Acts 13. 38, 39. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 John 2. 2. <hi>He is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world,</hi> John 1. 29. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> v. 21. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruized for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, and we have turned every one to his own courſe, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all,</hi> Iſai. 53. 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. VVhat is required of thoſe to whom ſinnes are forgiven. Although ſin in reſpect of us is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given freely, we can do nothing whereby to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe forgiveneſſe of ſin, yet ſomething is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to prepare for it, and to make capable of it. Thus there is required, 1. Faith; <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe</hi> (ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>that thorough his Name whoſoever believeth in him,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:111827:216"/> ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Act. 10. 43. <hi>By him all that believe are juſtified,</hi> &amp;c. ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> Act. 13. 39. Faith is the hand that laies hold on Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him, for whoſe ſake ſin is forgiven. To receive Chriſt is nothing els then to believe in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. The nature of faith is ſet forth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, Heb. 11. 13. <hi>All theſe died in faith, having not received the promiſes</hi> (that is, the things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) <hi>but ſaw them afar off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them;</hi> which ſhews that to the making up of Faith, juſtifying and ſaving faith, there muſt be firſt knowledge, <hi>they ſaw the promiſes,</hi> though it were afar off, yet they ſaw them, they had ſome, though but a dim and weak knowledge of them. 2. Aſſent, <hi>they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of them.</hi> 3. Application, <hi>they embraced them,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Repentance. Chriſt commanded, <hi>that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name,</hi> Luk. 24. 47. Firſt Repeutance, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins; no remiſſion of ſins without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. So <hi>Peter</hi> preaching Chriſt unto the Jews, ſaid, <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſins,</hi> Act. 5. 31. And Act. 3. 19. <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi> Now repentance importeth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sorrow for ſin. <hi>I will be ſorry for my ſin,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 38. 18. <hi>Ephraim</hi> repenting ſmote upon his thigh, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 19.

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:111827:216"/> will declare mine iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 38. 18. <hi>I</hi>

This is <hi>to be ſorry after a godly manner,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. &amp; 11. <hi>This godly ſorrow worketh repentance unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to be repented of,</hi> v. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Turning from ſin; <hi>He that covereth his ſinnes ſhall not proſper; but he that confeſſeth and for ſaketh them, ſhall have mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. 13.<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="3">3. Forgiving of others; this alſo is requiſite for the obtaining of forgiveneſſe. So Chriſt hath taught us to pray, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſſe against us,</hi> Mat. 6. 12. &amp; he adds v. 14, &amp; 15. <hi>For if ye forgive men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, your heavenly Father wil alſo forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither wil your Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi> And when <hi>Peter</hi> came unto Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Lord, how oft ſhall my brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him? untill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times?</hi> Chriſt anſwered, <hi>I ſay not unto thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:111827:217"/> ſeven times, but untill ſeventy times ſeven,</hi> Mat. 18. 21, 22. And immediately he propounded a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable whereby to ſhew how much it concerneth every one to forgive others, if he would have God to forgive him. The parable is of a King, who having a ſervant that ought him a huge debt, which he was no whit able to pay, upon his humble ſubmiſſion and intreaty forgave him; but hearing that the ſaid ſervant would not forgive his fellow-ſervant a ſmall debt, was exceeding wroth with him, and exacted his debt of him. <hi>So likewiſe</hi> [ſaid our Saviour, making application of the parable] <hi>ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their treſpaſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Novv for the uſe of the point. 1. VVhat comfort is here for the people of God? Although in themſelves they be guilty of ſin, both original, and actuall, though they vvere born in ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. and have lived in ſin, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. 6. though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually they are falling into ſin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 2. Yet this is their comfort (and greater comfort then this they need not deſire) thorough Chriſt they are reconciled unto God, all their ſins are pardoned, and done away as if they had never been. See what expreſſions are uſed in Scripture, whereby the forgiveneſſe of ſins is ſet forth vnto us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. VVhen ſins are forgiven they are ſaid not to be imputed: <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. Sins are injuries done unto God, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences committed againſt him; but though we have offended him, and have been injurious unto
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:111827:217"/> him, yet if we lay hold on the Covenant that he hath made with us in Chriſt he will forgive us, and not impute the ſins that we are guilty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin when it is forgiven, is ſaid to be blotted out; <hi>According to the multitude of thy tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies blot out my tranſgreſſions,</hi> Pſal. 51. 1. Sins are debts, <hi>Forgive us our debts;</hi> ſo it is according to the Originall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 12. As God hath a note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book for good deeds, <hi>A book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought on his Name,</hi> Mal. 3. 16. And in reference to this book <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prayed, ſaying, <hi>Remember me, O my God, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the houſe of my God, &amp;c.</hi> Neh. 13. 14. So he hath alſo a debt-book for ſins; but if we humbly and unfainedly turne unto him, he will blot our ſins out of his book, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver charge them upon us, never exact payment and ſatisfaction of us, ſeeing Chriſt hath made it for us, having with his blood <hi>blotted out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, &amp;c.</hi> Col. 2. 14. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> uſeth this ſame meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore of blotting out, but he fetcheth it another way; <hi>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud, thy ſins,</hi> Eſa. 44. 22. There ſinnes are compared to a cloud, a thick cloud which interpoſeth betwixt God and us, and keepeth off the bright beams of Gods favour and the light of his countenance from ſhining upon us: <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated betwixt you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you,</hi> ſaith the ſame Prophet, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59. 2. But
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:111827:218"/> ſins being remitted the cloud is blotted out, it is diſperſed and diſpelled, it vaniſheth and is gone, that we may behold the face of God as of a loving Father, reconciled to us in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sinnes are ſaid to be covered when they are pardoned; <hi>Thou haſt forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou haſt covered all their ſin,</hi> Pſal. 85. 2. By this expreſſion is ſignified, that the people of God, even his true and faithfull people, have ſin in them, but their ſin being forgiven, it is as it were covered and hid from the ſight of God, he doth no more impute ſin unto them then if he did ſee no ſuch thing in them: If in this ſenſe onely the Antinomians did hold that God ſees no ſin in his people, I ſhould readily ſide with them; but they have a perverſe meaning in it,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> book, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Gods eye upon Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> that a child of God cannot ſin, need not, nay ought not to be humbled for ſin, which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is as agreeable unto Scripture, as that which is moſt repugnant to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sins are ſaid to be caſt behind Gods back when he doth forgive them; <hi>Thou hast caſt all my ſins behind thy backe,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ezekiah</hi> to God, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi> 38. 17. God ſets the ſins of the wicked before his face, <hi>they are before my face,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 2. But for ſuch as turne unto him, he caſts their ſins behind his back; he will no more condemn them for their ſins, then if they were quite remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of his ſight, and he had no knowledge of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When ſins are remitted, they are ſaid to be caſt into the bottome of the ſea: <hi>Thou</hi> (O Lord)
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:111827:218"/> 
               <hi>wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea,</hi> Mic. 7. 19. This ſhewes more emphatically how when God forgives ſins, they are done (as it were) quite out of his ſight; that which is caſt into the depths of the ſea is not like to be found again, nor to be ſeen any more; <hi>In thoſe dayes, and in that time, ſaith the Lord, the iniquity of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I reſerve,</hi> Jer. 50. 20.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sins in this caſe are ſaid to be forgotten, and never more to be remembred. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. God wil no more take vengeance on his people for their ſins, then if he had quite forgotten them, and had no remembrance at all of them. <hi>All his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 18. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some may object, that after <hi>David</hi> had truly repented of his ſin, and alſo had the pardon of it declared unto him by the Prophet, he was puniſhed for it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, the Papiſts abuſe this and the like examples, inferring from them, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the fault, yet doth not remit the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that ſtill vve muſt one vvay or other, either here or hereafter make ſatisfaction unto God for ſin committed againſt him. But as the Antinomians erre in denying caſtigatory puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted upon Gods children, ſo doe the Papiſts erre in affirming ſatisfactory puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted on them. God afflicts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:111827:219"/> them whom he pardons, not as exacting ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of them (for how then are they pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?) but as chaſtening them, that they may the better learn to beware of ſin afterwards, and that others ſeeing them to ſmart for it, may beware of it. <hi>When we are judged, we are chaſtned of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It is <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>that we ſhould not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. So that God doth execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he doth inflict puniſhment upon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet it is but a chaſtening of them for their good, not that he doth take vengeance on them, or exact ſatisfaction of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly, ſeeing this great benefit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto the people of God, let us take heed leaſt we come ſhort, let us make ſure that we may be partakers of it. To ſtir us up hereunto let us conſider, 1. How much the purchaſing and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this benefit hath coſt, even no leſſe then the bloud of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins,</hi> ſaid Chriſt when inſtituting the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his Supper he gave the Cup unto his Diſciples, Mat. 26. 28. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſaluation?</hi> Heb. 2. 3. If we make light of that, which did coſt Chriſt ſo dear?</p>
            <p>2. What account the Saints have made of this benefit: The Prophet <hi>Mica</hi> admiring the goodneſs of God in this reſpect, cries out, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage? he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy,</hi> Mic. 7. 18. How earneſtly did <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:111827:219"/> ſue unto God for it? <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Lord, according to thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; according to the multitude of thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies blot out my tranſgreſſions: Waſh me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſinne,</hi> Pſalme 51. 1, 2. And v. 9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſinnes, and blot out mine iniquities.</hi> And Verſe 14. <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from blood-guiltineſſe, O God, thou God of my ſalvation, and my tongue ſhall ſing aloud of thy righteouſneſſe:</hi> And how exceedingly did he rejoyce when he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of this benefit? <hi>Bleſse the Lord, O my ſoule, and all that is within me bleſse his holy Name: Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits; Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, and healeth all thy diſeaſes; who redeemeth thy life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and crowneth thee with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and tender mercies,</hi> Pſalme 103. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>3. That forgiveneſſe of ſins is ſuch a benefit, ſuch a bleſſing, as even bleſſedneſſe it ſelfe the greateſt bleſſedneſſe that we are capable of here in this life, doth conſiſt in it; <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered; Bleſſed is he to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 32. 1, 2. Sin being forgiven, nothing can doe us hurt, all affliction will be light and eaſie, death it ſelfe will be advantage to us; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. This is it that makes affliction grievous and hard to be indured, then uſually a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:111827:220"/> will flie in his face, and ſet his ſins before him: Thus it is ſometimes even with the godly themſelves; <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Job</hi> unto God) <hi>and makeſt me to poſſeſſe the ſins of my youth,</hi> Job 13. 26. <hi>Mine iniquities</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) are gone over my head, and are as a heavy burthen too heavy for me to bear,</hi> Pſal. 38. 4. <hi>Woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us that we have ſinned,</hi> ſaid the people of God, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5. 16. And they adde, v. 17. <hi>For this our heart is faint, for theſe things our eyes are dim.</hi> O what a happineſſe then is it in time of affliction to have ſins forgiven, and to be aſſured of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of them! So alſo when death approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: For the guilt of ſin lying upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will make death terrible, it will cauſe us to ſay unto it, as <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eliah, Haſt thou found me, O mine enemy?</hi> Whereas if we be aſſured of intereſt in Chriſt, and of forgiveneſſe of ſinnes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough him, we may ſay with old <hi>Simeon, Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation,</hi> Luke 2. 29, 30. This bleſſedneſſe here to have our ſinnes forgiven, doth make way immediately for the bleſſedneſſe of the life to come, for that <hi>inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, Coloſ. 1. 12. <hi>Forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance among them that are ſanctified,</hi> are immediately joyned together, Acts 26. 18. Therefore as we deſire the inchoation of happineſſe here, and the conſummation of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:111827:220"/> happineſſe hereafter, as wee would live comfortably, die chearfully, and after death injoy immortality, and glory; let us make ſure of this benefit, the forgiveneſſe of our ſins, and then nothing can debar us from all bliſſe, all happineſſe.</p>

            <p>THe Author of this Epiſtle ſpeaking of <hi>the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> as he calls them, v. 1. mentioneth this as one of them, <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead.</hi> And therefore alſo in the Creed, wherein thoſe principles of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are contained, among other articles is that of <hi>the Reſurrection of the body:</hi> and mark <hi>of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> for there is alſo a Reſurrection of the ſoul (as hath been ſhewed * before) but that is a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall<note place="margin">Serm. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſoul being ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> naturally dead in ſin, is ſaid to riſe again, when the life of grace is infuſed into it: but the Reſurrection of the dead ſpoken of in the Text, is in reſpect of the body, as appears by the words immediately following, <hi>and of eternal iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For the Reſurrection of the body is previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the laſt judgement, and accompanied with it.</p>
            <p>The point then to be inſiſted on is this,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:111827:221"/> That the Reſurrection of the body is a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> point of Chriſtian Religion. It is neceſſary for all to know and believe, that the bodies of the dead ſhall riſe again.</p>
            <p>This is a great myſtery, naturall reaſon cannot reach to the knowledge of it, will not yeeld aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto it. When <hi>Paul</hi> preached at Athens, the moſt famous Academie in the world for humane learning, the Philoſophers encountred him, and ſome called him a <hi>babler;</hi> and others ſaid, <hi>He ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be a ſetter forth of ſtrange gods, becauſe he preached unto them Jeſus, and the Reſurrection,</hi> Act. 17. 18. &amp; v. 32. it's ſaid again, <hi>And when they heard of the Reſurrection of the dead, ſome mocked, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaid, we will hear thee again of this matter:</hi> they would demur upon it, and not be forward to believe it.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates, that the Heathens perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Hiſt. l. 5. c. 1</note> Chriſtians burnt their bodies to aſhes, and caſt them into the river, inſulting over them, and upbraiding them with their belief of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſaying, <hi>Let us ſee now if they will riſe again:</hi> Yea among the Jews, Gods peculiar people, who had the Oracles of God committed unto them, there was a ſect of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who denied the Reſurrection of the dead, Mat. 22. 23. <hi>The ſame day came to him the Sadduces, which ſay that there is no Reſurrection.</hi> So Act. 23. 8. <hi>For the Sadduces ſay, that there is no Reſurrection.</hi> Yea and alſo among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, there have been ſome who have ſaid, <hi>that there is no Reſurrection of the dead;</hi> ſome ſuch there were among the Corinthians, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. And it ſeems that <hi>Hymene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:111827:222"/> and <hi>Philetus</hi> were of this opinion, for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking of them, ſaith, <hi>Who concerning the truth have erred, ſaying, That the Reſurrection is paſt already, and overthrow the faith of ſome,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 17, 18. In that they ſaid, <hi>The Reſurrection is paſt already,</hi> it ſeemeth that they would only have a Reſurrection of the ſoul here, but no Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body hereafter. But mark, the denying of this article, the Reſurrection of the body, is called by the Apoſtle an overthrowing of the faith. Whatſoever we believe, if we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, that the dead ſhall riſe again, is all in vain and to no purpoſe, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, 1 Cor. 15. 12. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now the Reſurrection of the dead is proved two waies, as we ſee by thoſe words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Sadduces, <hi>Ye do erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God,</hi> Mat. 22. 29.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The power of God proves that the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is poſſible, and may be. <hi>Power belongeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God,</hi> Pſal. 62. 12. Even ſuch power, as that <hi>he is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can either ask, or think,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 20.

            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures ſhew that the Reſurrection is certain, and ſhall be; that as God can raiſe the dead, ſo he will do it: <hi>Job</hi> made no queſtion of it; <hi>For I know</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God: whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and not another, though my reines be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med within me,</hi> John 19. 25. 26, 27. True it is, the words there in the originall, as in many other places of that book, are ſo conciſe, as that they render the ſenſe obſcure, and are ſubject to divers expoſitions, ſo that both the Jewiſh Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,<note place="margin">Mercerus in lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:111827:223"/> 12. 2. By awaking theſe out of the duſt of the earth, he means the riſing again of the dead. And whereas he ſaith that many ſhall, it is not ſo to be taken as if all ſhould not; for many ſometimes are oppoſed not unto al, but only unto few. So it's ſaid, Rom. 5. 19. <hi>that by the diſobedience of one man</hi> (of <hi>Adam) many were made ſinners,</hi> that is, all; but thoſe all are many, and ſo are they that ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of the duſt of the earth, as all that ſleep there ſhall. So the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> likewiſe doth ſing the ſame ditty. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my dead body ſhall they ariſe: awake, and ſing ye that dwell in duſt, for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead,</hi> Iſai. 26. 19.

            <p>Thus the Scriptures of the old Teſtament give ſufficient proof of the Reſurrection of the dead; but much more clearly and fully do the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:111827:223"/> Scriptures of the new Teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpeak of it. <hi>The hour is coming</hi> (ſaid our Saviour) <hi>in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth.</hi> &amp;c. John 5. 28, 29. <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection at the last day,</hi> ſaid <hi>Martha</hi> of her brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> John 11. 24. The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 14. and ſo on to the end of the Chapter, ſpeaks of the Reſurrection of the dead; and ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. thoroughout the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Beſides theſe direct and expreſſe teſtimonies of Scripture, there are divers arguments &amp; reaſons grounded upon, &amp; confirmed by Scripture, which do further prove the Reſurrection of the dead.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is recovered in and by Chriſt, which was loſt in and by <hi>Adam.</hi> This argument the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle uſeth to prove that the dead ſhal be raiſed. <hi>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the Reſurrection of the dead. For as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 21, 22. viz. all that are Chriſts, as he explains it, v. 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſts Reſurrection doth neceſſarily inferre the Reſurrection of thoſe that belong unto Chriſt. How the Apoſtle both 1 Cor. 15. and alſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places proves the Reſurrection of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by Chriſts Reſurrection, and alſo in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect this inference is of force, I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſpeaking of the reſurrection of Chriſt (Serm. 19. towards the end.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gods Covenant with his people, that he will be their God, <hi>Gen. 17. 7.

               </hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were dead, yet God ſtiled himſelf their
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:111827:224"/> God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 6. And hence our Saviour confuted the Sadduces, who denied the Reſurrection; <hi>But as touching the Reſurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was ſpoken unto you by God, ſaying, I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob? <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> Mat. 22. 31, 32. In ſome ſenſe God is the God of the dead, as the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living,</hi> Rom. 14. 9. But in the Sadduces ſenſe God is not the God of the dead, that is, not ſo of the dead, as if they ſhould be alwaies dead, ſo they ſuppoſed, and ſhould never live again: <hi>For all live unto him,</hi> ſaid our Saviour immediately after the words before cited, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> records chap. 20. v. 38. All live unto God both in reſpect of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and alſo in reſpect of his purpoſe; he both can quicken the dead, and alſo will quicken them, as that very ſpeech ſhews, wherein he calls himſelfe the God of thoſe, with whom he had entred into Covenant, though now they were dead when he thus ſpake of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some may ſay, that God may be the God of his people in reſpect of their ſouls, though their bodies never riſe again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that this is not ſufficient, the ſoul is not the whole man, but a part only, the body alſo is a part as well as the ſoul. But God is by Covenant the God of his people in reſpect of the whole man, and not in reſpect of a part only. And therefore this argument drawn from Gods Covenant, and the everlaſtingneſſe of it,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:111827:224"/> proves a neceſſity of the Reſurrection of the body.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

As the things were done in the body, ſo the recompence and reward muſt be received in the body: And this is one reaſon (as I have ſhewed <note n="*" place="margin">Serm. 24</note> before) why beſides the particular judgement, which paſſeth only upon the ſoule, there muſt be a generall Judgement wherein both ſoul and body muſt be judged.</p>

Now if this be ſo, that the dead muſt riſe againe, then even in this reſpect there ought to be a reſpect had unto the dead, to bury them in a devout manner: Nature it ſelf doth teach this, that the bodies of the dead are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the earth; the Heathens generally did uſe it, excepting ſome who were more barbarous then others. As it is ſaid of the Hyrcanians, that they uſed to caſt dead bodies to dogs to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured.</p>
            <p>The Romans in later times uſed to burne the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:111827:225"/> bodies of the dead, but more anciently (as <hi>Plinie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plin. Hiſt. l. 7. c 54.</note> teſtifies) they did uſe to inter them, and that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of burning <hi>Sylla</hi> (as the ſame Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates) brought in, fearing leaſt ſome ſhould deale with him and his adherents after their death, as he had dealt with his adverſary <hi>Marius,</hi> whoſe body he had cauſed to be digged up after it was buried. But to ſpeak of Gods people, they have ſhewed themſelves very carefull to perform this office of buriall unto the dead: The Story of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in this reſpect is recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. where we find how ſollicitous he was about the burying of <hi>Sarah</hi> when ſhe was dead: So it's ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 2. that <hi>devout men carried</hi> Stephen <hi>to be buried.</hi> It was a cuſtome among the Jewes to waſh the dead body before they did bury it, as appears by that <hi>Acts 9. 37. Whom when they had waſhed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tarquinii cor pus bona fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, &amp; unxit. <hi>Ennius.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>they laid her in an upper chamber.</hi> The ſame cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome alſo was among the Heathens. The Jewes uſed alſo to imbalme the dead, as appears by <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 7. and 19. 39, 40. The Heathens alſo have uſed the ſame, eſpecially the Egyptians, as both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Hiſtory ſheweth, and alſo ſacred, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. Now though the Heathens did uſe theſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies vainly and ſuperſtitiouſly, yet no queſtion but the people of God had reſpect therein to the Reſurrection, ſhewing by theſe ceremonies which they uſed about the dead, that they believed that the dead ſhall riſe again. Now there is no need of ſuch ceremonies for that end, the Article of the Reſurrection being by the Goſpell more fully manifeſted then before: Yet this is of perpetuall obſervation, that the bodies of the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:111827:225"/> dead be decently buried, as being in due time to be raiſed up againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly, this point touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection doth teach us not to lament immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately for the dead: Lawfull it is to mourne in this caſe; nature requires it, and grace doth not forbid it, as not extinguiſhing naturall affections, but only rectifying them, and ſetting bounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Yea, the Apoſtle reckons it among the groſſeſt ſins, to be <hi>without naturall affection,</hi> Rom. 1. 31. The Saints have expreſſed their affection in this kind: <hi>Abraham</hi> mourned for <hi>Sarah, Gen. 23. 2. Joſeph</hi> fell upon his fathers face and wept when he was dead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 1. The godly made great lamentation for <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 8. 2. Yea Chriſt himſelf wept at the grave of <hi>Lazarus, Joh.</hi> 11. 35. Whereupon the Jewes that were preſent ſaid, <hi>Behold how he loved him,</hi> v. 36. But this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſorrow for the dead, muſt be moderate, and that as in other reſpects, ſo in this, that the dead even in reſpect of the body, do not periſh for ever, but at length ſhall riſe againe. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the Apoſtle uſeth to this purpoſe; <hi>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not even as others that have no hope: For if we believe that Jeſus died and roſe againe, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Ieſus will God bring with him,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. The conſideration of this point, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſurrection of the dead, is of great force to comfort us in all afflictions, and to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate us againſt the fear of death it ſelf. This did
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:111827:226"/> ſupport <hi>Iob</hi> in his greateſt extremity, as appears<note place="margin">Job. 19. 25. 26. 27.</note> by the words before cited, and ſo it may well ſupport all that truly fear God, as <hi>Iob</hi> did: Death (which is the worſt that can befall them) is but as the pulling down of an old ruinous houſe, to build it againe in a more excellent and glorious manner: Or as if a ſtatue of braſſe, or any other mettall, being full of ruſt, and decayed with age, ſhould be caſt into a furnace and melted, that ſo it may be made more pure and perfect then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Death in Scripture is often termed ſleep; as when a man ſleeps, he awakes again, and riſes up more lively and vigorous then he was before, ſo ſhall the godly ariſe after death, and be in a condition incomparably better then this which here they are in. The Apoſtle ſhewes what a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is betwixt the body as now it is, and as it ſhall be in the Reſurrection; <hi>It is ſowne in corruption, it is raiſed in incorruption: It is ſowne in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory: it is ſowne in weakneſſe, it is raiſed in power: it is ſowne a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, it is raiſed a ſpirituall body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 42, 43, 44. The hope of this Reſurrection did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Saints and ſervants of God to indure the greateſt torments that their inraged adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries could inflict upon them: <hi>They were tortured, not accepting of deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection,</hi> Heb. 11. 35.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. Finally ſeeing there ſhall be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, it behoves us to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour whiles we are here that we may attaine unto a bleſſed Reſurrection hereafter, <hi>the Reſurrection of life,</hi> Joh. 5. 29. which is <hi>the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:111827:226"/> Reſurrection of the juſt,</hi> Luke 14. 14. There ſhall indeed be a Reſurrection of all, <hi>both of juſt, and the unjuſt,</hi> Acts 24. 15. But as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Iudas, It had been better for him that he had not been borne;</hi> ſo may I ſay of the wicked, It were better for them that they ſhould not riſe againe, becauſe they ſhall riſe unto condemnation, John 5. 29. But as for the righteous, they ſhall ſo riſe, as <hi>to ſhine like the Sun in the Kingdome of their Father,</hi> Mat. 13. 43. Let us labour that we may be partakers of this Reſurrection: And to this end we muſt here have our part in the firſt reſurrection, that<note place="margin">Rev. 20. 6.</note> of the ſoul from the death of ſin to the life of grace, and then the ſecond death ſhall have no power over us.</p>
            <p>More particularly, firſt, we muſt be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Chriſt by faith; <hi>For he is the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and the life, he that believeth in him, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live: And whoſoever liveth, and believeth in him, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver die,</hi> viz. eternally, Iohn 11. 25. Chriſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready riſen from the dead, and entred into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo in due time ſhall all that belong unto Chriſt, that are members of his body; <hi>He will change their vile bodies, and make them like unto his owne moſt glorious body,</hi> Philip. 3. 21.</p>
            <p>2. But if we would be thus conformed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt in glory, and happineſſe, we muſt be conformed unto him in grace and holineſſe; <hi>Every one that hath this hope, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:111827:227"/> even as he is pure,</hi> 1 Iohn 3. 3. <hi>Paul</hi> having ſaid, that he believed that there ſhall be a Reſurrection both of juſt and unjuſt, addes, <hi>And herein doe I exerciſe my ſelfe to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence both towards God and towards men,</hi> Acts 24. 16. <hi>As many as walke according to this rule, peace ſhall be upon them, and mercy,</hi> Gal. 6. 16.</p>

               <hi>LIfe everlasting</hi> is the concluſion of the Creed, and ſo S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it <hi>the end of our faith; even the ſalvation of our ſouls,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 9.</p>
            <p>For the words of the Text, they were ſpoken by our Saviour, and that upon this occaſion: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> having ſeen how a certain rich man was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to forfeit his portion in the world to come, then to forgo his wealth that he had here in this world, ſaid unto Chriſt, <hi>Lo we have left all, and followed thee,</hi> v. 28. Then Chriſt let him and the reſt of his Diſciples know, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor any others ſhould looſe any thing by parting with all for his ſake, but ſhould be well recompenced for it even here in this world, and much more in the world to come: <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Verily, I ſay unto you, there is no man that hath left houſe, or Parents, or brethren, or wife, or children for the Kingdome of Gods ſake, who ſhall not receive manifold more in this preſent
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:111827:228"/> time, and in the world to come life everlaſting,</hi> v. 29, &amp; 30.</p>
            <p>The point to be obſerved is this, That as there <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> is a temporall life for all here in this world, ſo there is an eternall life for ſome hereafter in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Both the Old and the New Teſtament beare witneſſe to this truth, life everlaſting is aſſerted in both, yet more ſparingly and obſcurely in the Old Teſtament, more frequently and clearly in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>As for the Old Teſtament, I do not find that everlaſting life is expreſly mentioned in it, ſave only once, <hi>viz. Dan. 12. 2. Many of them that ſleep in the dust of the earth, ſhall awake, ſome to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life, &amp;c.</hi> Yet though not in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words, the Old Teſtament doth afford ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofs, that after this life there is another life to come, not as this, induring only for a time, but for ever: God did ſhew this unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, firſt by types, figures, and reſemblances:</p>
            <p>As firſt, the tree of life mentioned Gen. 2. &amp; 3. That was a type and figure of everlaſting life, as appears by that Rev. 22. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandements, that they may have right to the tree of life,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo Rev. 2. 7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> In theſe places by the <hi>tree of life</hi> is meant eternall life, whereof that tree called the tree of life was a figure. What further uſe that tree was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, is over-curious, and not neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: As for that <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22, 23. where it is ſaid,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:111827:228"/> that <hi>Adam</hi> having ſinned, God caſt him out of Paradiſe, <hi>leaſt he ſhould put forth his hand, and take of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever;</hi> that (I ſay) the beſt Expoſiters take as ſpoken onely in reſpect of that opinion which <hi>Adam</hi> had, <hi>viz.</hi> that if he did eat of that tree, he ſhould never die; like as when God ſaid (as is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) <hi>Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evill;</hi> it was ſpoken ironically in reſpect of that which the Serpent ſaid unto the woman, that if they did eat of the forbidden fruit, they ſhould be as Gods, knowing good and evill, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. Some have thought that if man had eaten of the tree of life, he ſhould have thereby been free from death: But certainly the tree in it ſelfe could have no ſuch vertue in it, onely God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it as a Sacramentall ſigne of everlaſting life, and man having by his tranſgreſſion made himſelf unworthy of the thing, God would not ſuffer him to meddle with that whereby the thing was ſignified.</p>
            <p>2. The Sabbath ſpoken of in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and in other places of Scripture, did alſo prefigure eternall life, it was a figure of that everlaſting Sabbath or reſt (for ſo the word Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath doth ſignifie as much as reſt) which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall keep in heaven. This is evident by the Apoſtles diſcourſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. where having ſpoken of Gods reſt when the workes of Creation were finiſhed, in memory whereof God inſtituted the Sabbath, he ſaith, v. 9. <hi>There remaineth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a rest to the people of God;</hi> the word there ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>a reſt,</hi> imports (as is noted in the Margent) <hi>a</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:111827:229"/> 
               <hi>keeping of a Sabbath.</hi> So that in the very word there uſed there is a manifeſt alluſion to the Jewiſh Sabbath, as a type of that Sabbath or reſt there ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> eternall in the world to come. Which is further evident by that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, v, 11. <hi>Let us therefore labour to enter into that reſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Land of Canaan, into which God brought the Iſraelites, after that he brought them out of Egypt, as is recorded in the book of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> that likewiſe did typifie heaven, and that reſt which the Iſraelites after a long and weariſome travell in the wilderneſſe enjoyed in that Land, did typifie that reſt, which the Saints having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thorough the wilderneſſe of this world, ſhall enjoy in heaven. This alſo is clear by comparing the words of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 95. 11. with the Apoſtles diſcourſe upon them, <hi>Heb. 4. 7, 8. David</hi> ſaith that God being provoked by the Iſraelites that came out of Egypt, <hi>ſware in his wrath that they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>David</hi> alledgeth this to deter others in after ages from provoking God in like manner, ſaying, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 95. 7, 8. The Apoſtle hence proveth that by Gods reſt cannot be meant the Land of Canaan, or reſt in that Land; for that the people to whom <hi>David</hi> ſpake, were then in that Land, and did enjoy that reſt, and ſo the Iſraelites had done long before: <hi>Again, he limiteth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day, ſaying in</hi> David, <hi>To day, after ſo long a time,</hi> (viz. that the Iſraelites had reſted in Canaan) <hi>as it's ſaid, to day if ye will hear his voice harden
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:111827:229"/> not your hearts. For if Ieſus</hi> (that is <hi>Ioſua</hi> as the margent noteth, who brought the Iſraelites into Canaan) <hi>had given them reſt, then would he not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward have ſpoken of another day.</hi> That is, if that reſt in Canaan which <hi>Joſua</hi> as their Captaine and Leader brought them into, had been all the reſt which God intended for his people, then he would not ſo long after by <hi>David</hi> have ſaid, <hi>To day,</hi> &amp;c. threatning them that except they were obedient unto him, they ſhould be debarred from entring into his reſt. This argues that God by his Reſt meant another reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> an everlaſting reſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whereof that reſt in Canaan was but a figure. Thus the Apoſtle there immediately infers, <hi>There remaineth therefore a reſt unto the people of God,</hi> v. 9. and addes v. 11. <hi>Let us labour therefore to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that rest, leaſt any man fall after the ſame exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of unbelief.</hi> And hence it was that the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes did make ſuch account of the Land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. <hi>Jacob</hi> cauſed <hi>Joſeph</hi> to ſwear that he would not bury him in Egypt, where he died, but carry him into Canaan, and bury him there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 29. 30, 31. And the ſame charge he gave to all his ſons immediately before his death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 29. &amp;c. And they did what he enjoyned them, as is related <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. where alſo v. 25. is ſhewed how <hi>Ioſeph</hi> likewiſe made his brethren to ſwear that they would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his bones with them into Canaan when they went. And <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 19. it is ſaid that Moſes <hi>took the bones of</hi> Joſeph <hi>with him,</hi> when he and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites went out of Egypt. <hi>Stephen</hi> alſo ſhewes that ſo the reſt of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons, though they died in Egypt, were carried into Canaan to be laid
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:111827:230"/> there, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 15, 16. Theſe Patriarks had not any ſuperſtitious opinion of that Land, as the Jews of late times have, and ſo the Papiſts have of Churches and Church-yards, but they both ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to die in faith, not doubting but that God at length would perform the promiſe that he had made concerning the Land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and alſo they looked at that Land as a type of heaven, where eternall reſt is prepared for all Gods elect people.</p>
            <p>2. In the time of the old Teſtament God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto his people that there is a life everlaſting in the world to come, by examples of ſome, whom he took and tranſlated out of this world into the other without death intervening: Thus it is ſaid Gen. 5. 24. that <hi>Enoch wnlked with God, and he was not, for God took him;</hi> That is, <hi>he was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. So <hi>Eliah</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up alive into heaven, as we read 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. Theſe examples ſhew that beſides this life here in this world, there ſhall be another hereafter in the world to come.</p>
            <p>3. After that <hi>Abraham Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were dead, God ſtiled himſelf <hi>the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>&amp; the God of</hi> Jacob, Exod. 3. 6. Now as Chriſt ſaid unto the Sadduces, <hi>God is not God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> Mat. 22. 32. God ſo ſtiling himſelf their God, ſhewed that both their ſouls did ſtill live, though ſeparated from their bodies, and alſo that their bodies ſhould be raiſed again, and both ſouls and bodies being reunited, ſhould live for ever. And thus is life everlaſting proved by the old Teſtament.</p>
            <pb n="449" facs="tcp:111827:230"/>
            <p>But the new Teſtament is more full and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe to this purpoſe. Chriſt <hi>hath brought life and immortality to light thorough the Goſpell,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 10. Before Chriſts coming life and immortality lay hid, it was but darkly diſcovered, but now by the Goſpell it is brought to light, it is clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. The places of the New Teſtament, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in which everlaſting life is expreſſely mentioned, are ſo many, that it were endleſſe, and they are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that it is needleſſe to recite them.</p>
            <p>Now everlaſting life is begun here but perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted hereafter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is begun here: <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath</hi> (not, ſhall have, but hath) <hi>everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 36. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life,</hi> John 5. 24. Everlaſting life as begun here is the life of grace, of which that is meant, 1 John 3. 14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death to life,</hi> (that is, from the death of ſin to the life of grace) <hi>becauſe we love the brethren:</hi> that this life of grace is life everlaſting by inchoation, S. <hi>John</hi> ſhews immediately after, v. 15. <hi>Whoſoever hateth his brother, is a murtherer, and ye know that no murtherer hath eternall life in him.</hi> So that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life doth abide in the children of God whileſt they are here; it is here begun in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is perfected hereafter; and therefore it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>in the world to come life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,</hi> becauſe the fulneſſe and perfection of it is not here in this world, but in the world to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In reſpect of the ſoul this life is perfected immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after its ſeparation from the body. For it is a
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:111827:231"/> groſſe and monſtrous opinion, that ſome both in former times, and alſo in theſe times, have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Aug. de Hereſ. cap. 83. Calvin. de Pſycho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panncuhia.</note> that the ſoul doth either die with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or doth ſleep when it is out of the body. <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to the believing malefactor, Luke 23. 43. <hi>We know tht when this earthly houſe of our Tabernacle is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, we have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternall in the heavens,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 Cor. 5. 1. And the ſpirits or ſouls of juſt men departed out of this life are called <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12. 23. In reſpect of the body everlaſting life is perfected when the body is raiſed up, and of corruptible and mortall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes incorruptible and immortall. And in this reſpect both in the Creed, and alſo in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, everlaſting life is put after the Reſurrection of the body. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2. and <hi>John</hi> 5. 29. becauſe at, and by the Reſurrection everlaſting life is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated and made perfect in reſpect of the whole man, both ſoul and body. Now as everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life in reſpect of it's inchoation and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning here, is called the life of grace, ſo in reſpect of it's conſummation and perfection hereafter, it is called the life of glory. That which is called the <hi>Crown of life,</hi> Revel. 2. 10. is called the <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 4. And that which in other places is termed <hi>eternall life,</hi> is termed <hi>eternall glory</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 10. The life of grace here, and the life of glory hereafter, differ not in kind but in degree. Grace is an inchoation and beginning of glory; and glory is a conſummation and perfection of grace.</p>
            <pb n="451" facs="tcp:111827:231"/>
            <p>What a life this everlaſting life (conſidered in its fulneſſe and perfection, the life of glory) is, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they fully and perfectly know, who do enjoy it. It is <hi>a glory that ſhall be revealed,</hi> Rom. 8. 18. It is not revealed yet, but ſhall be hereafter. This life <hi>is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3. 3. <hi>It doth not yet appear what we ſhall be,</hi> 1 John 3. 2. But thus much the Scriptures plainly ſhew, that this life is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Chriſt when he cometh, <hi>ſhall be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that beleeve,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 10. And that it conſiſts in a clear viſion of God, and a full fruition of him. <hi>Now we ſee thorough a glaſſe darkly, but then face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. <hi>When he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like unto him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 John 3. 2. Chriſt pronounceth the pure in heart bleſſed, becauſe <hi>they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5. 8. And he alſo makes the happineſſe of the Angells to conſiſt in this, that <hi>they alwaies behold the face of God,</hi> Mat. 18. 10. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> thought <hi>Solomons</hi> ſervants hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that they did continually ſtand before him, and hear his wiſdome, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 8. What a happineſſe then is it to be for ever in the preſence of God, and to enjoy immediate communion with him!</p>
            <p>Such is the happineſſe of the life to come, as that it ſhall be free from all evill, and full of all good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſhall be free from all evill, both evill of<note place="margin">Poſſe non peccare.</note> ſin, and evill of affliction. 1. There ſhall be no ſin there. <hi>Adam</hi> had a poſſibility of not ſinning; but there ſhall be an impoſſibility of ſinning: the beſt here are imperfect, but there all imperfection is<note place="margin">Non poſſe peceare.</note>

Now if ſin even in the regenerate be ſo grievous, as the complaints of the Saints do ſhew it is, <hi>mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, they are too heavy for me to bear,</hi> ſaid <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 38. 4, And <hi>Paul</hi> by reaſon of thoſe reliques of corruption that were in him, cried out, <hi>O wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 7. 24. How great a happineſſe then will it be to be altogether freed from ſin, as they are that do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the life to come? Then ſhall the Church indeed be glorious, when it ſhall be <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither ſhall there be any affliction in the life to come. <hi>All tears ſhall be wiped away,</hi> Revel. 7. 17. There ſhall be no ſuffering, no ſorrow there.</p>
            <p>But to be exempt from evill, all evill, this is but one and the leſſer part of happineſſe. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy good, all good, this is it indeed, that which doth make happy. And therefore,</p>
            <p>2. The life to come is not only free from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but alſo full of all good. VVhat good can be deſired, but there it ſhall, and that in full meaſure, be enjoyed? There God is enjoyed to the full, and they that enjoy him, enjoy all: There are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>the true riches,</hi> Luke 16. 11. There is glory, <hi>a far more exceeding and eternall weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17.

               <hi>of the Lord, that which I alſo delivered unto you,</hi> &amp;c. the word is that from whence is derived the other that ſignifieth <hi>Tradition.</hi> That which the Apoſtle there ſaith he delivered, was delivered not only by ſpeaking, but alſo by writing, as is evident by that which follovveth in the ſame place. See alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But (ſay they) the Apoſtle bade the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians hold the Traditions, which they had been taught, whether by word, or by his Epiſtle: and therefore unwritten Traditions are to be held, as wel as thoſe that are written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It follows not; that becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſome things to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> by word, which he did not deliver by writing, therefore ſome things are to be received by Tradition, which are not contained in the Scripture, For 1. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> are but a part of the Scripture, ſo that many things are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scripture, which are not contained in thoſe Epiſtles. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> might deliver ſomething to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> which was requiſite for them, and yet was no matter of faith, neceſſary for all to hold. If it were of ſuch concernment, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts for all their Traditions, are as far to ſeek as we. For I preſume they can no more tell then we, what it was which the Apoſtle delivered to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> meerly by word, which he did not
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:111827:238"/> deliver by writing: But no marvel if the Papiſts ſo contend for Traditions, when as they hold and maintain many Doctrines: as Purgatory, Prayer for the dead, Prayer to Saints, and a hundred more, which have no ground at all in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but are moſt repugnant to it: they are like<note place="margin">

And ſo much alſo the Scripture ſhews of them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 3, 4. But ſee how our Saviour cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them for this, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Again, they of the Church of Rome will not allow us to build upon the Scripture, but upon the authority of the Church, that is indeed upon the authority of the Pope, for ſo they reſolve all at length into him. His decrees and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they wil have all to ſubmit unto without any more ado, without examining or conſidering whether they be conſonant or no unto Scripture. <hi>But to the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay) if they ſpeak not according to this</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 20.</note> 
               <hi>word, it is becauſe they have no light in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> They object that heretikes alledge Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore it is not ſafe to reſt in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, ſo the devil did alledge Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet did our Saviour confute him by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. and ſo by Scripture muſt heretiques be confuted, although in defence of their hereſies they alledge Scripture. See <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 28.</p>
            <p>But again, they of the Romiſh Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Scripture from people, and wil not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial diſpenſation allow them to look into
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:111827:238"/> it, and how then ſhould their faith be grounded upon it, as it ought to be?

            <p>2. To confute the Enthuſiaſts, who rely on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſpirations and revelations of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo vilifie and deſpiſe the Scriptures: but let them boaſt of the ſpirit as much as they will, certain it is, that whileſt they contemn the word as they do, the ſpirit which they are led by, is not that ſpirit which Chriſt promiſed, <hi>the Spirit of</hi>

And therefore moſt preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:111827:239"/> are they, who wil diſjoyn them one from the other.</p>
            <p>3. To confute many opinions that are ſtarted up among us in theſe times, they are called <hi>new lights,</hi> but whether they be new or old they are falſly called lights, being oppoſite to that true light, the Scripture, to which we muſt take heed,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19. Iſai. 8. 20.</note> 
               <hi>as to a light ſhining in a dark place:</hi> they that broach theſe opinions, ſpeak not according to the Law and the teſtimony, and therefore <hi>there is no light in them.</hi> That the moral Law is now of no uſe to a believer; that he is not to confeſſe ſin, nor to be humbled for ſin; that the ſoul is not immortall, that Chriſt is not God coeſſentiall with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if theſe and many ſuch like doctrines, which are now ſpread abroad in the Land, be lights, I wonder what we ſhall call darkneſſe. Certainly the Prince of darkneſſe, even in the darkeſt times of Popery, did never deviſe ſuch damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and helliſh blaſphemies, as are now maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I ſay with S. <hi>Peter, Seeing you know theſe things before, beware leaſt ye alſo be carried away with the errour of the wicked, and fall from your own ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord, and Saviour Ieſus Christ,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 17. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly, if matters of faith be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scripture, let it be our care to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelves well with the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the doctrine therein delivered, and to hold it faſt. There are 3. branches of this Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us acquaint our ſelves well with the Scripture. <hi>Search in the book of God, and read,</hi> Iſai. 31. 16. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> John 5. 39. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:111827:239"/> 1. That God hath ordained the Scriptures for this end, that we might be inſtructed and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them. <hi>They were written for our learning,</hi> Rom. 15. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is a ſingular mercy that we have the Scriptures. <hi>David</hi> magnifies the goodneſſe of God towards the Iſraelites in this reſpect; <hi>He hath given his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ſtatutes and his Ordinances unto</hi> Iſrael. <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 147. 19, 20. So <hi>Paul</hi> notes this as the great priviledge which the Jews had above others, that <hi>unto them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 1, 2. The greater the mercy is, the more grievous is the contempt of it. <hi>I have written unto them</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>the great things of my Law, and they were counted as a ſtrange thing,</hi> Hoſ. 8. 12.</p>
            <p>2. Let us embrace the doctrine delivered in the Scripture. Not every doctrine that is preached or printed; no, take heed of that. <hi>Believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits, whether they be of God; for there are many falſe Prophets gone out into the world,</hi> 1 John 4. 1. <hi>Prove all things,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 21. And how muſt we prove and try every doctrine but by the Scriptures? ſo the Bereans did, and they are commended for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. But having<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 8.</note> tried a doctrine, and found it agreeable to the Scripture, we muſt embrace it, we muſt take heed of ſtumbling at the word, as <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith ſome do. Some ſtumble becauſe of the many opinions that are abroad, becauſe ſome hold one thing, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, therefore they will hold nothing. Take heed of this; conſider 1. That it hath been thus of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:111827:240"/> old in matters of Religion: In our Saviours time there were ſeverall opinions concerning him, <hi>Some ſaid he is a good man; others ſaid, nay, but he deceiveth the people,</hi> Joh. 7. 12. See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Joh. 7. 40.—43. and Mat. 19. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture hath foreſhewed, that there ſhall be falſe doctrines and hereſies; <hi>There ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 24. 24. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the people, even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 2. 1.</p>
            <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such is the malice of Satan, that he will doe what he can to pervert the truth: where God ſowes good corne, he will ſow tares, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 39.</p>
            <p>4. God ſuffers it to be ſo, firſt, to try thoſe that are his; <hi>There muſt be hereſies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 19. See Deut. 13. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>2. That the truth may be more cleared and confirmed then otherwiſe it would be, if it were not impugned and oppoſed: See Acts 15. 1. 2. 6. 7, 22. &amp;c. 30. 31. It is obſerved, that the Doctors that were before <hi>Pelagius,</hi> wrote more ſecurely concerning grace and free will, but when <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> aroſe, and aſſerted free will, ſo as that he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew grace, then <hi>Austine</hi> and others beſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves, and made it evident, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods grace man hath no power nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in him to do any thing whereby to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>But again, ſome ſtumble at this, that ſuch as
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:111827:240"/> were eminent for profeſſion, fall into groſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; but neither is there any cauſe to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at this: For thus alſo it hath been even in the Apoſtles time, <hi>Nicolas</hi> was of no mean repute in the Church, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 5. Yet (it ſeems) he became the Author of a deteſtable Sect called the Nicolaitans, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 15. So what account <hi>Paul</hi> made of <hi>Demas,</hi> we ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 14. and <hi>Philem.</hi> verſe 24. yet he proved an Apoſtate, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
            <p>2. This alſo is fore-told: <hi>The Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly, that in the later times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 4. 1. The falling away of Profeſſors ſhould make us take heed to our ſelves, and cleave the more cloſe to the truth, as <hi>Peter</hi> admoniſheth, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 17. Take heed leſt ye alſo be carried away with the error of the wicked, and fall from your ſtedfastneſſe.</hi> So I come to the third branch of the Exhortation.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore let us hold faſt the truth delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scripture; <hi>Buy the truth and ſell it not,</hi> Prov. 23. 23. <hi>Hold faſt that which is good,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 21. <hi>Hold faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 1. 13, 14. <hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering,</hi> Heb. 10. 23.</p>
            <p>To this end, firſt be well grounded in the truth; falſe Teachers <hi>eaſily lead captive ſilly women, that are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 6, 7. <hi>That we henceforth be no more children, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 4. 14.</p>
            <pb n="466" facs="tcp:111827:241"/>
            <p>2. Be ſincere in the profeſſion of the truth: <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11, 12.<note place="margin">Superbia eſt mater omnium haereſeôn.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Be humble: <hi>Pride</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtine) is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all hereſies.</hi> And <hi>Calvin</hi> found it verified in <hi>Servetus</hi> a wretched heretike; he notes of him, that he was exceeding proud, and being deſirous to get himſelfe a name, thought this the faireſt way<note place="margin">Luſitanico fastu inflatus, magis etiamnum propriâ arrogantiâ turgens, hanc ſibi comparandi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis rationem optimam eſſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit, ſi omnia religionis principia convelleret. <hi>Calvin. adverſ. Servet.</hi>
               </note> whereby to attaine unto it, to ſhake the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion: So the Scripture teſtifies of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who bewitched the people of Samaria, (and as Eccleſiaſticall Writers record of him, was the Author of divers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies) that <hi>he gave out that himſelf was ſome great one,</hi> Acts 8. 9. Doubtleſſe, this is a main cauſe why many in theſe times fall into groſſe and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous errors, they are puffed up with a conceit of themſelves, and they would be eminent above others; and therefore rather then they will be content with plain truth, they will imbrace pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable error. Beſides, the proud truſting in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, God leaves them to themſelves, and ſo what is ſo abſurd, but through the ſuggeſtion of Satan, and the corruption of their owne heart, they are ready to imbrace it? <hi>A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſdome, but he findeth it not,</hi> Prov. 14. 6. For <hi>God ſcorneth the ſcorners, but giveth gracee unto the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:111827:241"/> lowly,</hi> Prov. 3. 34. <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> Jam. 4. 6. and 1 Pet. 5. 5.</p>
            <p>4. Beware of covetouſneſſe and worldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſſe; earthly advantages are of great force to with-draw from the truth. This was it that drew away <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. <hi>Demas hath forſaken me, having loved this preſent world: Peter</hi> ſpeaking of falſe Teachers, ſhewes that this doth ſet them on work, <hi>And through covetouſneſſe ſhall they make merchandiſe of you,</hi> 2 Pet. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>5. Beware of all ſin whatſoever. For it dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the underſtanding, perverts the will, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the affections, alienates from God, and gives advantage unto Satan. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of a ſtrange woman, may be applied to a ſtrange Doctrine; <hi>Who ſo pleaſeth God, ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 26. The Apoſtle therefore bidding <hi>hold faith,</hi> addes, <hi>and a good conſcience, which ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put away, concerning faith have made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 29. And ſo he notes, that they are not only <hi>ſilly women,</hi> but ſuch alſo as are <hi>laden with ſins,</hi> that are uſually led captive by falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>6. Labour to increaſe grace more and more; <hi>Take heed leſt ye alſo being carried away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſſe; but</hi> (as a means to avoid that miſchief) <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>7. Pray continually unto God to guide and keep you in the truth, except God lead us into
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:111827:242"/> it, we ſhall never find it, and except he keeps us in it, we ſhal ſoon loſe it: <hi>The God of al grace, &amp;c. make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen ſettle you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 10. <hi>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, &amp;c.</hi> Jude v. 24. and ſo much for this point.</p>
            <p>Again the words of the Text hold out unto us this, That Chriſtians ought earneſtly to contend <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> for the truth; to do what in them lies to preſerve &amp; maintain it, againſt thoſe that do oppoſe it. All Chriſtians ought <hi>to be fellow-helpers to the truth,</hi> 3 Jo. 8. Such are commended as do this: <hi>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evill, and thou haſt tried them which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them liars,</hi> Revel. 2. 2.</p>
            <p>Such are reproved as neglect this. <hi>But I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, &amp;c. So hast thou alſo them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate, Repent &amp;c.</hi> Revel. 2. 14, 15, 16. Good reaſon there is why Chriſtians ſhould do this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Out of zeal for Gods glory. As wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, ſo alſo wicked opinions diſhonour God. Heretikes eſpecially ſet their mouths againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and therefore they that are zealous for God will ſet their mouths againſt them, and doe what they may to repreſſe them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Out of compaſſion towards others. Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be ſhewed towards an oxe or an aſſe that goes aſtray, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 13. How much more towards the ſouls of men, that either are already, or are like to be ſeduced and carried away with errours?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Out of compaſſion towards themſelves. For
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:111827:242"/> it being a duty required of them, a neceſſity is laid upon them to do it, and woe unto them if they do it not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. Whatever it be that God injoyns us to do, if we have no reſpect unto it, we reward evill unto our ſelves, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3. 9. but as all muſt do this, ſo not all one &amp; the ſame way, but ſeverally according to the places and callings God hath ſet them in.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Magiſtrates muſt do it. The care of the<note place="margin">Cuſtodes utriuſque Tabulae.</note> Church and of Religion belongs unto them, as well as of the Common-wealth and of civill ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: otherwiſe how are they nurſing Fathers, and nurſing Mothers, as God hath ſaid they ſhall be? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49. 23. How by their means do we live a quiet &amp; peaceable life in all godlineſſe and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty? in which reſpect the Apoſtle bids pray for them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 2. Magiſtrates therfore muſt do their endeavour to preſerve and maintain the truth. and that 1. By making Laws and Ordinances for the profeſſion and preſervation of it. Thus did the good Kings of Judah, not only <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> who were Prophets, as well as Kings, but alſo they Kings only, and not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as <hi>Aſa, Jehoſhaphat, Ezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah:</hi> and memorable to this purpoſe is the example of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> though a heathen. See what a decree he mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7. 25, 26. And how <hi>Ezra</hi> bleſſed God for it, v. 27. &amp; 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By providing Orthodox Miniſters to teach the truth, and by incouraging them that do it. Thus Jehoſhaphat <hi>ſent Levites who taught in</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>and had the book of the Law of the Lord with them, and went about thoroughout all the Cities of</hi>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:111827:243"/> Judah, <hi>and taught the people,</hi> 2 Chron. 17. 8, 9. <hi>And</hi> Ezekiah <hi>ſpake comfortably unto all the Levites, that taught the good knowledge of the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 30. 22. <hi>Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to give the portion of the Prieſts &amp; the Levites, that they might be incouraged in the Law of the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron 31. 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By repreſſing ſuch as pervert the truth, and divulge errours. The Magiſtrate is <hi>the Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. Now if they do evill that hurt the body, and prejudice the temporall eſtate; how much more they that hurt the ſoul, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the eternall eſtate?</p>
            <p>2. Miniſters muſt do it, and that 1. By preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and teaching the truth with all diligence: See Act. 20. 28, 31. &amp; 2 Tim. 4. 1, 5. &amp; Tit. 1. 10, 11. with 2. 1.</p>
            <p>2. By refelling ſuch as oppoſe the truth, and<note place="margin">

To this end he muſt preach, <hi>not with entiſing words of mans wiſdom, but in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit, and of power,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4. <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> was eloquent, and that is good, but withall he was <hi>mighty in the Scriptures,</hi> Act 18. 24. <hi>And ſo he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publikely, ſhewing by the Scriptures, that Jeſus was Chriſt,</hi> v. 28.</p>
            <p>3. Private Chriſtians muſt doe it: And 1. By praying for good and ſound teachers: they muſt pray that they may be ſent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 38. And that they may do the work for which they are ſent, 2 Theſ. 3. 1. Col. 4. 3. Epheſ. 6. 19, 20.</p>
            <pb n="471" facs="tcp:111827:243"/>
            <p>2. By affording them all incouragement that may be: See 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
            <p>3. By giving no aſſiſtance, ſhewing no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to falſe teachers, but doing what they may to reſtrain them: See 3 <hi>Iohn 10, 11. Deut.</hi> 13. 6, 9.</p>
            <p>4. By inſtructing and admoniſhing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>5. By humbling themſelves, and mourning for the errours that are vented, and for thoſe that are ſeduced; See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 158. &amp; 136.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us then according to our places and callings be mindfull of this duty, and carefull to perform it: to this end let us conſider, 1. That truth (eſpecially the truth of Religion, <hi>the truth of the Goſpell</hi>) is a thing moſt precious and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 5.</note> moſt worthy to be contended for with all earneſtneſſe, and to be maintained with all care and diligence: <hi>God is the God of truth,</hi> Iſa. 65. 16. Chriſt hath ſtiled himſelf <hi>the truth,</hi> John 14. 6. the Holy Ghoſt is <hi>the ſpirit of truth,</hi> John 16. 13. <hi>The Goſpel is the word of truth,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 13. If therefore we contend for other things, which in compariſon are vain and frivolous; how much more ſhould we contend for this which is of ſuch worth, of ſuch excellency?</p>
            <p>2. That the Saints &amp; ſervants of God have ever ſhewed great zeal in this kind. How zealous <hi>Paul</hi> was for the truth, his Epiſtles every where ſhew. See eſpecially <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9, &amp; 2. 5, 11, 12, 13, 14. &amp; 4 &amp; 3. 1, 3, 4, 11, 19. &amp; 5. 7. 12. of S. <hi>John</hi> it is recorded by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and before him by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that being in a bath, and hearing that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> (one who
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:111827:244"/> beſides other hereticall opinions, denied Chriſts divinity) was come into the place, he would ſtay no longer, but departed with all ſpeed, ſaying to thoſe that were with him, <hi>Let us flie, and be gone, leaſt the building fall upon us, in which this enemy of the truth</hi> Cerinthus <hi>is.</hi> So it is ſaid of <hi>Polycarpus (S. Iohns</hi> Diſciple) that meeting with <hi>Marcion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Arch-heretike, and being asked by him, if he knew him, anſwered, <hi>Yes, I know thee to be the firſt born of the divell.</hi> And ſuch was the zeale of <hi>Hierome</hi> againſt heretikes and hereſies, that in his ſecond Apology againſt <hi>Ruffinus</hi> he writes thus; <hi>In this one thing I cannot</hi>
               <note place="margin">In uno tibi conſentire non poſſum, ut parcam haereticis, ut me Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum non probem. Si iſta est cauſa diſcordiae, non poſſum tacere, non poſſum.</note> 
               <hi>yeeld unto thee, that I ſhould forbear heretikes, and ſo not prove my ſelf a ſound and true believing Chriſtian. If this be the cauſe of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I cannot hold my peace, I cannot do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That wicked opinions are rather worſe then wicked practiſes; corrupt Doctrines more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then corrupt manners. Some do well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that he who had the leproſie in his head, is pronounced not ſimply unclean, as others, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unclean, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. 44. Whence is collected, that corruption in judgement is worſe then cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in practice. And ſo it is; the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the eye, and ſo the light of the ſoul; <hi>and if the light be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 23.</note> Sound doctrine is a means to reforme a corrupt converſation; but corrupt doctrine is a means to marre a good converſation. <hi>Evill communications corrupt good manners,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 33. <hi>Whoſoever
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:111827:244"/> ſhall break one of the leaſt Commandements, and teach men ſo,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 5. 19.</p>
            <p>4. Great need eſpecially at this time to be earneſt for the truth, and to do what we may for defence of it. For, firſt, when was it ever more oppoſed then now it is? What he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie almoſt was ever broached, which is not now taken up, and maintained by one or other? Scarce any truth in all the ſphere of Chriſtian Religion is ſo ſacred, as to remain inviolate.</p>
            <p>2. Theſe wicked opinions that are among us cauſe the name of God to be blaſphemed, and the way of truth to be evill ſpoken of. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Papiſts take occaſion to traduce our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prophane perſons to deſpiſe all Religion.</p>
            <p>3. Theſe are times wherein God expects, and we pretend Reformation: Therefore that now in theſe times ſhould be ſuch Sects and Hereſies amongſt us, is the more hainous; <hi>I ſaid ſurely, thou wilt feare me, thou wilt receive correction,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but they roſe up early, and corrupted all their ways,</hi> Zeph. 3. 7. <hi>Thou ſaidst, I will not tranſgreſſe, when on every high hill, and under every green tree thou wandredſt, playing the Harlot,</hi> Ier. 2. 20.</p>
            <p>4. We have ſolemnly ſworne unto God, and covenanted with him to indeavour in our places and callings the preſervation of the truth, and the extirpation of hereſie, and whatſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crary to ſound Doctrine: Let us remember that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 76. 11. <hi>Vow and perform unto the Lord your God.</hi> And that of <hi>Solomon</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 4, 5. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleaſure in fools: Pay therefore
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:111827:245"/> that which thou haſt vowed. Better is it that thou ſhouldſt not vow, then that thou ſhouldst vow and not pay.</hi> Some have ſhewed themſelves very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt Superſtition, Popery, Prelacy, &amp;c. but concerning Sects and Hereſies, which ſwarm in the Land, have been remiſſe enough: Why is not one part of the Covenant regarded as well as another? Zeale if it be not impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, is not right, howſoever we may pleaſe our ſelves in it, and vaunt of it as <hi>Iehu</hi> did; <hi>Come, ſee my zeal,</hi> 2 King. 10. 16. <hi>But</hi> Jehu <hi>regarded not to walk in the Law of the Lord with all his heart; for he departed not from the ſins of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>the ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of</hi> Nebat, <hi>who made Iſrael to ſin,</hi> v. 31. Had his zeal been ſincere, it would have ſhewed it ſelfe as well againſt the Idolatrous Worſhip of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Calves ſet up by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> as againſt that of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>al</hi> ſet up by <hi>Ahab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us conſider theſe things, and let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them incite us by prayer and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and all good means (as our places and callings require) to indeavour that truth may be preſerved, and error ſuppreſſed; that ſuch as are yet in the truth, may perſiſt in it, and ſuch as are ſwerved from the truth, may be reduced to it, or at leaſt may not ſeduce and draw others from it. In a word, let us do what in us lies, that the land may be purged, as from other pollutions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, ſo from theſe Sects and Hereſies, that are ſo rife in it; that ſo the Lord may not (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we muſt needs fear he will) abhor us, and depart from us, but may ſtill continue his gracious preſence with us, and rejoyce over us to do us good.</p>
