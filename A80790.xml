         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:111827:3"/> The con≈øideration of the growth and ≈øpreading of ≈øuch pernicious errors, moved me in the cour≈øe of my Mini≈øtery to ≈øpend ≈øome time in handling the <hi>fir≈øt principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> (as they are called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12.) the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and fundamentall points of Religion, according to the method and order of the Creed, called the Apo≈øtles Creed, wherein they are comprized. This I conceived very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite and needfull, as a chief means, if not to recover tho≈øe that are infected, yet to pre≈øerve others from infection: For (as one well ob≈øerves) a principall way of fortifying our<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> Serm. on the day of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the growth of errors, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øies, &amp;c. pag. 57.</note> ≈øelves again≈øt the allurements and a≈ø≈øaults of fal≈øe Teachers, is <hi>to be grounded in the principles, of the Doctrines of Chri≈øt, or el≈øe we ≈øhall ea≈øily be tumbled up and downe like loo≈øe ≈øtones that lie not fa≈øt in the building upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi> The Apo≈øtle him≈øelf doth ≈øhew, that ≈øuch as are <hi>children</hi> (to wit, <hi>in under≈øtanding,</hi> either altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Doctrine of Faith, or not well grounded in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20.) are ready to be <hi>to≈ø≈øed to and fro, and carried away with every wind of Doctrine, by the ≈øleight of men and cunning craftine≈ø≈øe, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4. 14.

This knowledge is (as wofull experience ≈øhewes) much wanting in many: And hence it is, that errors and here≈øies have ≈øo prevailed among≈øt us, while≈øt ≈øome through ignorance are circumvented, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and drawne away, and others (though perhaps full of invectives again≈øt Sects, yet) have nothing to alledge in defence of truth, or onely that which is to little purpo≈øe, cu≈øtome, example, and the like; whereby it comes to pa≈ø≈øe, that the Authors and abettors of error do the more tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and ≈øuch as are in≈ønared by them, are the mo≈øt fa≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened unto them.</p>
            <p>I grant indeed, that it is not Chri≈øt in the head, but Chri≈øt in the heart; not a bare notionall knowledge of Chri≈øt, but a ≈øpirituall knowledge of him, that will ≈øerve the turne.

And ≈øome again, though perhaps they be Orthodox, and deliver nothing but what is ≈øound and true, yet are faulty in this, that they think it a ≈øufficient, yea a more then ordinary preaching of Chri≈øt, to have his Name fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in their mouthes, and in a generall way to ≈øpeake much of him, when as yet they never ≈øhew what he is, or what he hath done and ≈øuffered, nor ≈øcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver handle any one Article of FAITH concerning Chri≈øt, as if this were too triviall for them to trouble them≈øelves about, ≈øo that many poor ≈øouls, though they hear

            </p>
            <p>In this Chapter, out of which the Text is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, we have a large <hi>Encomium,</hi> or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, and a clear demon≈øtration both of the nece≈ø≈øity, and of the efficacy of it: that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done without it, <hi>Without Faith it is impo≈ø≈øible to plea≈øe God,</hi> v. 6. that nothing but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111827:5"/> may be done by it; this is proved by a cloud of witne≈ø≈øes throughout the Chapter.</p>
            <p>Faith is taken two wayes: 1. There is <hi>fides quae creditur,</hi> faith which we believe, the object and matter of Faith; thus is faith to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood, <hi>Jude v. 3. That you ≈øhould earne≈øtly contend for the Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints. 2. Fides qu√¢ creditur,</hi> Faith whereby we believe, the grace of faith inherent in the ≈øoule, the act whereof is to believe; thus is the word taken, <hi>Rom. 1. 17. The ju≈øt ≈øhall live by Faith,</hi> and <hi>Jam. 1. 6. Let him ask in Faith;</hi> and ≈øo in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places this is the proper acception of the word, though the other acception be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øuall.</p>
            <p>The object of Faith is God, and what≈øoever is revealed by God; <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but things revealed unto us, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 29. 29. The fir≈øt thing concerning. God to be believed, is as the Text doth tell us, that God is, <hi>He that cometh unto God, mu≈øt believe that God is;</hi> it followes, <hi>and that he is a rewarder of tho≈øe that diligently ≈øeek him:</hi> this mu≈øt al≈øo be believed, but the other fir≈øt, and then this; fir≈øt that God is, and then that he is a rewarder of tho≈øe that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ≈øeek him.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall now by Gods help in≈øi≈øt upon this fir≈øt principle of Religion, that God is, or that there<note place="margin">That there is a God.</note> is a God.</p>
            <p>Let none think that this is a ≈øuperfluous and needle≈ø≈øe labour, to go about to demon≈øtrate a thing ≈øo plain and evident as this is.</p>
            <p>For, 1. If this be a truth nece≈ø≈øary for all to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111827:5"/> know and believe, then it is not unnece≈ø≈øary to in≈øi≈øt upon it, and to confirm it, that we may ≈øee we have ju≈øt rea≈øon to believe as we do.</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture tells us of ≈øuch <hi>fools as ≈øay in</hi>
               <note place="margin">P≈øal. 14. 1.</note> 
               <hi>their heart, there is no God:</hi> And we read of ≈øome, though but few, who have denyed it not onely in their hearts, but with their mouths al≈øo.</p>
            <p>3. This is a corrupt age into which we are fallen, mo≈øt of the fundamentall truths are either denied, or doubted of; and though I doe not read or hear of any, that yet ≈øeeks to ≈øhake this <hi>ba≈øis</hi> of Religion, yet ≈øeeing (as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith) <hi>evill men and ≈øeducers will wax wor≈øe and wor≈øe,</hi> it<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 13.</note> is good to be fore-armed, and to prevent the wor≈øt.</p>
            <p>4. This being the main foundation of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it mu≈øt be laid ≈øure, that ≈øo the ≈øuper≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may be the more firm.</p>
            <p>The≈øe things premi≈øed, I come to the proof of the point, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a God.</p>
            <p>And 1. We have in this the generall con≈øent even of the Heathens, although <hi>Diagoras</hi> (they ≈øay) denied it, and <hi>Protagoras</hi> doubted of it, yet generally the Heathens did acknowledge it: yea, it's ≈øaid, that <hi>Protagoras</hi> was bani≈øhed by his Countrey-men the Athenians, becau≈øe he pre≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to que≈øtion ≈øuch a truth as this. <hi>Tullie</hi> a<note place="margin">Tul. de Nat.

            <p>2. There are many wayes, whereby the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, having only the light of nature, did yet<note place="margin">Tul. de Nat. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.</note> ≈øee this, that there is a God. <hi>Tullie</hi> mentioneth four wayes, by which they came to be convinced of this, and (which is ob≈øervable) I find all tho≈øe mentioned in Scripture as ≈øo many evictions of a Deity. 1. The fore-knowledge of things to come, <hi>viz.</hi> things that have no nece≈ø≈øary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon ≈øecondary cau≈øes, but in that re≈øpect are altogether contingent, though the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Heathens were generally ≈øuch as did not argue a divine power, yet the argument in it ≈øelfe is good, and ≈øufficient to convince an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie≈øt: It is certain, that things in re≈øpect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour cau≈øes meerly contingent, have been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhewed long before they came to pa≈ø≈øe. The Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> prophecied of <hi>Cyrus</hi> by name, though he died long before <hi>Cyrus</hi> was borne; ≈øo<note place="margin">E≈øa. 44. 28. &amp; 45. 1. 1 King. 13 2.</note> did another Prophet in like manner of <hi>Jo≈øiah.</hi> Now this knowledge of things to come is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto God, neither can any have it, but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpired by God. By this argument God proves him≈øelfe to be the true God, and the gods of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111827:6"/> Heathens to be Idolls, vanity, and nothing. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your cau≈øe</hi> (≈øaith the Lord) <hi>bring forth your ≈øtrong rea≈øons, ≈øaith the King of</hi> Jacob. <hi>Let them bring forth, and ≈øhew us what ≈øhall happen; let them ≈øhew the former things what they be, that we may con≈øider them, and know the latter end of them, or declare us things to come: ≈øhew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods,</hi> I≈øa. 41. 21, 22, 23. And again, <hi>I≈øa. 43. 9. Let all the Nations be gathered together, and let the people be a≈ø≈øembled: who among them can declare this, and ≈øhew us former things? viz.</hi> before they happen, as God ≈øhewed them by his Prophets, as <hi>Kimchi</hi> a Jewi≈øh Rabbin upon the place doth<note place="margin">

Men and Devils may ghe≈ø≈øe at things to come, but not certainly and infallibly know them: The Chaldeans were famous for A≈øtrologie and divination, yet the Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> derides them, and tho≈øe that gave credit to them; <hi>Stand now</hi> (≈øaith he to Babylon) <hi>with thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, and with the multitude of thy Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherein thou ha≈øt laboured from thy youth, if ≈øo be thou ≈øhalt be able to profit, if ≈øo be thou maye≈øt prevaile: Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy coun≈øells, let now the A≈øtrologers, the ≈øtar-gazers, the monethly Prognosticators ≈øtand up and ≈øave thee from the≈øe things that ≈øhall come upon thee: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they ≈øhall be as ≈øtubble, the fire ≈øhall burn them, they ≈øhall not deliver them≈øelves from the power of the flame,</hi> I≈øa. 47. 12, 13, 14. and v. 11. it's ≈øaid, that evill ≈øhould come ≈øuddenly upon Babylon, that ≈øhe ≈øhould not know of before it came upon her; ≈øo that her Diviners could not only not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

            <p>2. The great benefits which accrue unto men by the temperature of the ≈øea≈øons, and the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the earth, and the abundance of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commodities; and the Scripture ≈øhewes this al≈øo to be a good argument to prove that there is a God: The Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, that when God did not vouch≈øafe his Word unto men, <hi>yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈ø≈øe he left not him≈øelf without witne≈ø≈øe, in that</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>he did good, giving us rain from heaven, and fruitfull ≈øea≈øons, filling our hearts with food and gladne≈ø≈øe,</hi> Acts 14. 17.</p>
            <p>3. Thunder, pe≈øtilence, earthquake, and ≈øuch like terrifying and de≈øtroying accidents; ≈øo the Scripture al≈øo notes this as one means whereby God doth make him≈øelfe known, <hi>The God of glory thundereth,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David, P≈øal.</hi> 29. 3. and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times in that P≈øalme he calleth thunder Gods voice, by it God ≈øpeaks unto men, and proclaimes unto them that there is a God. It's ≈øaid of <hi>Caligula</hi> the Romane Emperour, that though he were otherwi≈øe mo≈øt mon≈øtrous, and would needs make him≈øelf a God, yet he were ≈øo affrighted with thunder, that he would run under a bed to hide him≈øelf; this voice of the Lord did make him know, that there is one who is not a meer titular God, or a God only by u≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and pre≈øumption, but a God indeed: So all the fearfull judgements that are in the world demon≈øtrate that there is a God. <hi>The Lord is knowne by the judgement that he executeth,</hi> ≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 9. 16.</p>

            <p>To the≈øe arguments I will adde but one more, and that is drawn from mans con≈øcience: There is a con≈øcience in man, which upon occa≈øion will accu≈øe, or excu≈øe; <hi>Their con≈øcience al≈øo bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe,</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>and their thoughts in the mean while accu≈øing, or el≈øe excu≈øing one anonher,</hi> Rom. 2. 15. though no man els be able to accu≈øe a man, yet con≈øcience will do it.

            <p>But thirdly, the word ≈øpirit is after a ≈øort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to an incorporeall ≈øub≈øtance, when Chri≈øt after his Re≈øurrection appeared to his Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and they thought that they had ≈øeen a ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Behold my hands and my feet</hi> (≈øaid he unto them) <hi>that it is I my ≈øelfe, handle me and ≈øee: for a ≈øpirit hath not fle≈øh and bones, as ye ≈øee me have,</hi> Luk. 24. 37, 39. and thus by ≈øpirit is ≈øometimes meant the ≈øoule of man, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 20.

            </p>
            <p>That God is a ≈øpirit, may be further proved by the≈øe Arguments:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is of mo≈øt excellency mu≈øt needs belong unto God, <hi>O Lord, how excellent is thy Name?</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David,</hi> P≈øal. 8. 1. 9. <hi>His Name only is excellent,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 148. 13.

God therefore being mo≈øt excellent, mu≈øt needs be as a ≈øub≈øtance not an accident, ≈øo a ≈øpirit, not a bodily ≈øub≈øtance: Indeed God is ≈øo excellent that no names can be found out, whereby ≈øufficiently to expre≈ø≈øe his nature, he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111827:13"/> infinitely tran≈øcends all other ≈øub≈øtances, and all other ≈øpirits; but yet apprehending God as we are able, we cannot but attribute the names of ≈øub≈øtance, and of ≈øpirit unto him.</p>

And Je≈øus, when he was baptized, went up ≈øtraitway out of the water, and loe the heavens were opened unto him, and he ≈øaw the Spirit of God de≈øcending like a Dove, and lighting upon him: And loe, a voyce from heaven, ≈øaying, This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, in whom I am well plea≈øed.</hi> Here we have the fir≈øt Per≈øon, the Father, who ≈øpake from heaven, as is plaine by tho≈øe words, <hi>My beloved Son:</hi> He who hath a ≈øon mu≈øt needs be a father.

And ≈øo al≈øo is the third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, the Spirit, the holy Spirit, or Holy Gho≈øt, who came down in the likene≈ø≈øe of a Dove: All the≈øe three are here ≈øo de≈øcribed and ≈øet forth, as that they plainly appeare to be di≈øtinct each from other. So the di≈øtinction of the Father and the Son, is evident from that 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9, 10. where it's ≈øaid, that <hi>God ≈øent his Son:</hi> by God there, mu≈øt needs be meant the Father, and the Per≈øon ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mu≈øt needs be di≈øtinct from the Per≈øon ≈øent, ≈øo con≈øequently the Father and the Son are two dictinct Per≈øons: And by the ≈øame rea≈øon ≈øo are al≈øo the Father and the Holy Gho≈øt; for the Father ≈øends, the Holy Gho≈øt is ≈øent, <hi>The Holy Gho≈øt whom the Father will ≈øend, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 14. 26. And ≈øo al≈øo the Son and the Holy Gho≈øt are by this rea≈øon proved to be two di≈øtinct
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111827:26"/> Per≈øons, the Son being the Per≈øon ≈øending, and the Holy Gho≈øt the Per≈øon ≈øent; <hi>I will ≈øend him unto you,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, ≈øpeaking of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, that is, the Holy Gho≈øt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7. How the≈øe three Per≈øons are di≈øtingui≈øhed one from another, is not ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary to be known, as that they are di≈øtingui≈øhed, neither may we be over-curious to inquire into it; but thus much the Scripture doth manife≈øt unto us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the di≈øtinction of the≈øe divine Per≈øons, that the Father is from none, the Son is from the Father, and the Holy Gho≈øt both from the Father and the Son: This is cleare from the places already alledged, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 9, 10. Joh.</hi> 14. 26. &amp; 16. 7. And this is ≈øufficient to ≈øhew, not only that they are di≈øtingui≈øhed, but al≈øo how they are di≈øtingui≈øhed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as they are three di≈øtinct Per≈øons, ≈øo they are one &amp; the ≈øame God: This appears by that, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho≈øt:</hi> except the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho≈øt were each of them God, we might not baptize, nor be baptized in their Name. For it is not lawfull to baptize, or be baptized in the Name of any but God, <hi>Were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 13. And again, v. 14, &amp; 15. <hi>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but</hi> Cri≈øpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius, <hi>lea≈øt any ≈øhould ≈øay, that I had baptized in mine owne name. Paul</hi> (we ≈øee) abhorred this as mo≈øt vile ≈øacriledge, as a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of God of his honour, that any ≈øhould
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:111827:26"/> be baptized in his name: So that prayer, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 24.

Now if they be each one of them God, then there being no more Gods then one, they mu≈øt needs be one and the ≈øame God.</p>
            <p>The Godhead of the Father is confe≈ø≈øed by all, the Godhead of the Son, and of the Holy Gho≈øt, I ≈øhall prove more fully and di≈øtinctly hereafter in their places; this proof may ≈øuffice for the pre≈øent.</p>

            <p>2. All the power that is in all the creatures, is from God, and therefore in a more eminent manner in God. The great <hi>Behemoth,</hi> that is, (as is ≈øuppo≈øed) the Elephant, <hi>who≈øe ≈øtrength is in his loines, and who≈øe force is in the navell of his belly: Who moveth his taile like a Cedar,‚ÄîWho≈øe bones are as ≈øtrong pieces of bra≈ø≈øe, and like barres of iron,</hi> Job 40. 16, 17, 18. This great <hi>Behemoth</hi> (I ≈øay) is but one, though among≈øt ≈øuch-like creatures, <hi>the chief one of the wayes</hi> (or works) <hi>of God. Job 40. 19. He that made him, can make his ≈øword to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto him.</hi> Ibid. Though he be never ≈øo ≈øtrong, yet he hath his ≈øtrength from God, who therefore is ≈øtronger, and can ≈øubdue him. Yea, further, all the power that all the creatures have, is Gods power, not onely as from him, but al≈øo as ≈øub≈øervient to him, he ordereth it and maketh
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111827:29"/> u≈øe of it as he plea≈øeth: <hi>The Angels that excell in ≈øtrength, do his Commandements, hearkning to the voice of his word,</hi> P≈øa. 103. 20. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> that had ≈øuch maje≈øty, and ≈øuch might, that all <hi>People, Nations, and Languages, trembled and feared before him; whom he would he ≈ølew, and whom he would he kept alive; whom he would he ≈øet up, and whom he would he put downe,</hi> Dan. 5. 19. even he was but Gods ≈øervant, as God doth call him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 9. &amp; 27. 6. God made him an in≈øtrument to execute his will, and to fulfill his plea≈øure: <hi>They wrought for me,</hi> ≈øaith God, ≈øpeaking of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> and his Army, when they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed that rich and ≈øtrong City Tyrus, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29. 26. The ≈øtrength of Bears and of Lions God u≈øeth at his plea≈øure, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 24. &amp; 17. 25. So the inanimate creatures which are of mo≈øt force and might, as fire, and haile, ≈ønow and vapour, and ≈øtormy wind, they doe but fulfill his Word, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 148. 8.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, God can inhibit and re≈øtrain the force and fury of the creatures, that they ≈øhall not put forth them≈øelves, nor act at all except he plea≈øeth: He ≈øtopped the mouthes of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they could do nothing unto <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 6. 22. He curbed and kept in the rage of the fire, that it could have no power over the three young men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 27. Againe, God can lift up the creature above it ≈øelf, and make it act above its power, when he plea≈øeth. He made one repa≈øt ≈øufficient for <hi>Eliah</hi> to go in the ≈øtrength of it forty daies, and forty nights, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 8. with five barley loaves and two ≈ømall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111827:29"/> fi≈øhes he ≈øatisfied many thou≈øands, and cau≈øed much to remain al≈øo of the fragments, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 5. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Finally, God can make the creatures work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven quite contrary to their nature: He made the waters to divide them≈øelves, and to ≈øtand on heaps, as if they had been walls of bra≈ø≈øe, or of marble, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 21, 22. He made the Sun to ≈øtand ≈øtill, <hi>Io≈øh.</hi> 10. and to go back, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 38. He made clay a meanes to open the eyes of him that was blind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 6. This may ≈øufficiently demon≈øtrate that God is Almighty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But there are ≈øome things which God cannot do, <hi>He cannot deny him≈øelf,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 13. <hi>He cannot lie,</hi> Tit. 1. 2.</p>

            <p>Now if God be Almighty, able to do what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he plea≈øeth, then let us not doubt of any thing that he hath ≈øpoken, but though it may ≈øeem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo ≈øtrange, yet let us be a≈ø≈øured of the truth of it. <hi>Why ≈øhould it ≈øeem a thing incredible with you, that God ≈øhould rai≈øe again the dead?</hi> (≈øaid the Apo≈øtle) Act. 26. 8. So Chri≈øt told the Sadduces, who denied the Re≈øurrection of the dead, that <hi>they erred, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God,</hi> Mat. 22. 29. What≈øoever it be that God hath promi≈øed, let us a≈ø≈øure our ≈øelves that it ≈øhall be fulfilled; let us take heed of calling into que≈øtion the power of God, as that noble man did, who when in a time of mo≈øt great ≈øcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Prophet <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> fore-told mo≈øt great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that to happen the very next day after, ≈øaid, <hi>Behold, if the Lord ≈øhould make windowes in heaven, might this thing be?</hi> 2 King. 7. 1, 2. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Prophet told him, that he ≈øhould ≈øee it with his eyes, but ≈øhould not ta≈øt of it; and ≈øo (as the ≈øtorie ≈øhews) it came to pa≈ø≈øe, for when that plenty happened, he being appointed of the King to keep the gate, was trodden on by the people, and ≈øo died. So the I≈øraelites in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈ø≈øe, que≈øtioned whether God were able to ≈øupply their wants, ≈øaying, <hi>Can God furni≈øh a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the wilderne≈ø≈øe?‚ÄîCan he provide fle≈øh for his people?</hi> P≈øa. 78. 19, 20. In ≈øpeaking thus, it's ≈øaid, <hi>they ≈øpake again≈øt God:</hi> It is a great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity unto God, to ≈øpeak or think ≈øo of him, as if his power were limited, as if there were any
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111827:31"/> thing above his reach, or without the ≈øphere of his activity, yet (which may make us take the more heed unto our ≈øelves) even the godly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves are ≈øubject thus to di≈øtru≈øt Gods power. <hi>Sarah</hi> hearing the Lord to promi≈øe that ≈øhe ≈øhould bear <hi>Abraham</hi> a ≈øon, laughed at it, as thinking it could not be, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and ≈øhe being both ≈øo old as they were, ≈øhould yet have a child, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 10, 11, 12. So when God told <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> that he would give the I≈øraelites in the wilderne≈ø≈øe fle≈øh to eat, and that for a moneth together, it ≈øeems that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did doubt of Gods ability to perform this promi≈øe: <hi>The people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom I am</hi> (≈øaid he) <hi>are ≈øix hundred thou≈øand foot-men, and thou ha≈øt ≈øaid, I will give them fle≈øh, that they may eat a whole moneth: Shall the flocks and the heards be ≈ølain for them to ≈øuffice them? or ≈øhall all the fi≈øh of the Sea be gathered together for them, to ≈øuffice them?</hi> That <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did not meerly inquire how this ≈øhould be done, but did even doubt how it could be done, may appeare by Gods an≈øwer unto him, <hi>And the Lord ≈øaid unto Mo≈øes, Is the Lords hand waxed ≈øhort? Thou ≈øhalt ≈øee whether my word ≈øhall come to pa≈ø≈øe unto thee, or not,</hi> Num. 11. 21, 22, 23. Thus al≈øo again, when the people murmuring for water, God bad <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ≈øpeak unto the Rock, and it ≈øhould powre forth water: <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in≈øtead of ≈øpeaking to the Rock, ≈ømote it twice, which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, and ≈øpake to the people, ≈øaying, <hi>Heare now ye rebells, mu≈øt we fetch you water out of this Rock?</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, Is this a likely thing to be done?

The≈øe examples ≈øhew how apt the godly are to faile in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of this point, touching Gods Almighty power: But let's beware of this evill heart of unbelief; for it much provokes God, as appears by the≈øe very examples now alledged: How he puni≈øhed the noble man for his incredulity, was noted before; <hi>Sarah</hi> al≈øo did not pa≈ø≈øe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a check, <hi>Gen. 18. 13.

            <p>THe Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaking of Chri≈øt, and ≈øetting forth his excellency, compares him with <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> who was of great account with the Jews, to whom the Apo≈øtle wrote; <hi>Who was faithfull to him that appointed him, as al≈øo</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all Gods hou≈øe,</hi> v. 2. But lea≈øt any ≈øhould conceive an equality betwixt Chri≈øt and <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> he goes on, and ≈øhewes the excellency of Chri≈øt above <hi>Mo≈øes; For this man was counted worthy of more glory then</hi> Mo≈øes, <hi>in as much as he who hath builded the hou≈øe, hath more honor then the hou≈øe,</hi> v. 3. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was but a part of the hou≈øe, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Church) but Chri≈øt the builder of the hou≈øe, and ≈øo the Lord and Ma≈øter of it, whenas <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> though he had a great place in it, yet was but a ≈øervant, v. 5. &amp; 6. Now having thus occa≈øionally mentioned hou≈øe and building, he in≈øerts as by way of Parenthe≈øis, the≈øe words, <hi>For every hou≈øe

            </p>
            <p>[<hi>All things,] Calvin</hi> liketh rather to limit this to all things belonging to the Church, the hou≈øe of God, mentioned both before and after; yet he confe≈ø≈øeth, that it may be extended to the whole Creation: This ≈øen≈øe ≈øeems mo≈øt agreeable to the words, that as every hou≈øe hath ≈øome man or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by whom it is built, ≈øo the great hou≈øe of the world that comprehends all things in it, had God for the builder, or maker of it.</p>

            <p>OUr Saviour having cured a lame man on the Sabbath day, the Jews hearing of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing de≈øirous to take any occa≈øion whereby to quarrell with him, ≈øought to pro≈øecute him as a tran≈øgre≈ø≈øor of the Law, and one that had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Sabbath, v. 16. Our Saviour ≈øo an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him≈øelf, as to let them know that they did not rightly under≈øtand the Commandement concerning the Sabbath, which was not to inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and re≈øtrain ≈øuch works as did evidently make for the glory of God, and the good of men, but only ordinary works, which hinder the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tho≈øe duties which God then requires. And he further ≈øhewes, that Gods re≈øting on the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, after that he had made all things in ≈øix daies, is not ≈øo meant, but that God doth ≈øtill continually work, though not in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in tho≈øe fir≈øt ≈øix dayes wherein he made the world, <hi>viz.</hi> ≈øo as to make any new kinds of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:111827:41"/> yet ≈øo as to pre≈øerve and govern the things that he hath made: And therefore to do any thing that is requi≈øite and needfull for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation either of man or bea≈øt, is not unlawfull. This is the meaning of the≈øe words; <hi>But Je≈øus on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</hi>

            <p>[<hi>My Father worketh hitherto,</hi>] viz. by pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and governing his creatures.</p>
            <p>[<hi>And I work,</hi>] viz. as God together with the Father, and as Man conformably to the Father.</p>
            <p>This ≈øufficing for the explication of the words, we may ob≈øerve from them, That all things are <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> continually pre≈øerved and governed of God.</p>
            <p>As God at fir≈øt made all things, ≈øo he ≈øtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øantly pre≈øerveth and governeth all things: That <hi>Gen. 2. 2.

            <p>God then on the ≈øeventh day cea≈øed to create any more, as he had done in the ≈øix dayes before; but he did not then, neither doth he yet cea≈øe to pre≈øerve and govern what he had created.</p>
            <p>That all things are pre≈øerved of God is clear by that <hi>Act. 17. 28.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:111827:48"/> cloud which went before the I≈øraelites in the wilderne≈ø≈øe when they journeyed, and was a guide unto them, and when they re≈øted abode over their heads, and kept off the ≈øcorching heat of the Sun from them, this cloud, I ≈øay, (of which ≈øee <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 21, 22.) was likewi≈øe a type of Chri≈øt, by whom alone we are protected from the fire of Gods wrath, and are directed to the heavenly Canaan. The Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, that the I≈øraelites <hi>were baptized unto</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>in the cloud:</hi> It was a kind of Bapti≈øme unto them; it was to them as bapti≈øme is to us, a Sacramentall ≈øign pointing at Chri≈øt, and ≈øhadowing forth ≈øalvation by him, and him only. And ≈øo al≈øo the Sea, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle ≈øheweth in the ≈øame place, viz. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. the Sea thorough which the I≈øraelites pa≈ø≈øed, when <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the Egyptians pur≈øued them, and were ready to de≈øtroy them, wherein al≈øo their adver≈øaries were drowned, as the ≈øtory is recorded in <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. Of this nature al≈øo was Manna wherewith God did feed the I≈øraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. The Apo≈øtle calls it <hi>Spirituall meat,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 3. becau≈øe it had a ≈øpirituall ≈øignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ≈øignified Chri≈øt, and the body of Chri≈øt, (even as now the bread in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper doth) that true bread which doth feed the ≈øoul unto eternall life, as Chri≈øt ≈øheweth at large, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. So al≈øo was the rock out of which God gave drink to the I≈øraelites in the wilderne≈ø≈øe, <hi>Exod. 17. That Rock was Chri≈øt,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. That is, it did repre≈øent and ≈øignifie Chri≈øt, like as Chri≈øt called the bread in the Sacrament his body, and the wine his blood,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:111827:49"/> which blood of his was al≈øo repre≈øented and ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by that water out of the Rock, which therefore the Apo≈øtle there calls <hi>Spirituall drink,</hi> in re≈øpect of the ≈øpirituall ≈øignification of it. The≈øe types and figures of Chri≈øt, I call extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and tran≈øient, becau≈øe they were only appointed upon occa≈øion, and to continue but for a ≈øhort time: But there were other types and figures of him which were of a more ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn in≈øtitution, and of a more durable nature, which therefore I call ordinary and permanent. Of this kind was the Pa≈ø≈øeover, or the Pa≈øchall Lamb, the blood whereof being ≈øprinkled on the doors of the I≈øraelites, they were pre≈øerved when the fir≈øt-born of the Egyptians were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. That Lamb was a figure of Chri≈øt, the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. by who≈øe blood we are ≈øaved, whenas all that are not ≈øprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with it, ≈øhall be de≈øtroyed; what is ≈øpoken of that Lamb, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 46. is applied unto Chri≈øt, and alledged as meant principally of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 36. So all the ≈øacrifices and other rites and ceremonies of the Law had reference unto Chri≈øt, and did typifie him as the only Redeemer and Saviour; <hi>Which are a ≈øhadow of things to come,</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, ≈øpeaking of ≈øome of them) <hi>but the body is of Chri≈øt,</hi> Col. 2. 17. <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Mo≈øes, <hi>but grace and truth came by Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> Joh. 1. 17. <hi>Grace</hi> in oppo≈øition to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, and <hi>truth</hi> in oppo≈øition to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law, which was but a ≈øhadow of tho≈øe things, the truth whereof is in Chri≈øt. <hi>For the Law having a ≈øhadow of good things to come<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:111827:49"/> not the very image of the things, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10. 1. <hi>For it is not po≈ø≈øible that the blood of bulls and goats ≈øhould take away ≈øin,</hi> v. 4. No, it's only the blood of Chri≈øt which was typified by the blood of tho≈øe creatures, that can do it. See there what follows in the ≈øame Chapter: And indeed the ≈øcope of the whole Epi≈øtle is to ≈øhew that the ceremoniall Law did but ≈øhadow out Chri≈øt, and therefore is now aboli≈øhed, Chri≈øt being come and having accompli≈øhed that which it ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed.</p>
            <p>Thus in the Scriptures of the Old Te≈øtament is Chri≈øt ≈øet forth, as he in whom alone ≈øalvation is to be found. But much more clearly and fully is this revealed in the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament; <hi>We u≈øe great plainne≈ø≈øe of ≈øpeech: And not as</hi> Mo≈øes, <hi>that put a vail over his face, &amp;c.</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, 2 Cor. 3. 12, 13. The Text in hand doth plainly tell us, that <hi>there is not ≈øalvation in any other, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. it's ≈øaid that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called <hi>Je≈øus, becau≈øe he doth ≈øave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ≈øins.</hi> And S. <hi>John</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us eternall life, and this life is in his Son: He that hath the Son, hath life; but he that hath not the Son, hath not life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 11, 12. Every where in the New Te≈øtament ≈øuch ≈øentences and ≈øayings are obvious.</p>
            <p>But for the fuller manife≈øtation of the truth of this Doctrine, let us further con≈øider that all the links of the golden chain of ≈øalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> Election, Redemption, Adoption, Ju≈øtification, Sanctification, and Glorification, all have reference unto Chri≈øt, and dependance upon him.</p>

See al≈øo <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 47. where this place is cited and expounded of Chri≈øt: So <hi>Simeon</hi> having Chri≈øt (as then a young babe) in his armes, ≈øaid, <hi>Lord now lette≈øt thou thy ≈øervant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace; for mine eyes have ≈øeen thy ≈øalvation, which thou ha≈øt prepared before the face of all people,</hi> Luk. 2. 29, 30, 31. True it is, all are not ≈øaved by Chri≈øt, but that is not through defect in Chri≈øt, nor through any inability in him to ≈øave, but through the indi≈øpo≈øedne≈ø≈øe that is in others to be ≈øaved: The pool of <hi>Bethe≈øda</hi> had in it vertue ≈øufficient to cure any, yet only ≈øuch were cured by it, as after the moving of the water by an Angell, did fir≈øt enter into it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. So there is ≈øufficient vertue in Chri≈øt to ≈øave any, yet only ≈øuch as believe in him, ≈øhall be ≈øaved by him. <hi>By him all that believe, are ju≈øtified, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 13. 39. <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to them that believed on his name,</hi> Joh. 1. 11, 12. <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life,</hi> Joh. 5. 40.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

From the Law: <hi>Chri≈øt hath redeemed us from the cur≈øe of the Law, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 3. 13.

O Death, where is thy ≈øting? O Grave, where is thy victory? The ≈øting of death is ≈øin, and the ≈øtrength of ≈øin is the Law; but thanks be unto God, that giveth us victory thorough Ie≈øus Chri≈øt our Lord.</hi> From the Devill: He came

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. He is able to ≈øave not only privatively, ≈øo as to remove all evil from us, but al≈øo po≈øitively, ≈øo as to confer all good upon us: Had <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> only been delivered out of pri≈øon, he would have thought it no ≈ømall favour; this was all that he reque≈øted the chief Butler to do for him, when he had ≈øo comfortably interpreted his dreame unto him: <hi>But think on me when it ≈øhall be well with thee, and ≈øhew kindne≈ø≈øe, I pray thee, unto me, and make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me unto</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IN the two Ver≈øes going before, <hi>S.

            <p>He was conceived in her, and ≈øo in her, as that he was conceived of her, that is, of her ≈øub≈øtance.

And that according to the fle≈øh, he was rai≈øed up <hi>of the fruit of</hi> Davids <hi>loines,</hi> Acts 2. 30. But this could not be, except that Chri≈øt did receive the ≈øub≈øtance of his body from <hi>Mary,</hi> who did de≈øcend from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and from <hi>David.</hi> A more direct te≈øtimony to this<note place="margin">Geen. 3. 15 Chri≈øt is called the ≈øeed of the woman.</note> purpo≈øe is that <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. where it's ≈øaid of Chri≈øt, that he was <hi>made of a woman,</hi> which woman was <hi>Mary</hi> before mentioned, he was not only made in her, but al≈øo made of her: ≈øo <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 42.

            <p>Whereas it is ≈øaid in the Text, <hi>of the Holy Ghost,</hi> it is meant of the Holy Gho≈øt not as the matter, but as the efficient, in which ≈øen≈øe it is ≈øaid, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 12. All things (are) of God.</hi> Again, though the Holy Gho≈øt only be expre≈ø≈øed, yet the other Per≈øons of the Trinity are not excluded: The Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaking of the Father, ≈øaith, <hi>Of whom are all things, 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 6. If all things be of the Father, then Chri≈øts body was of him, <hi>viz.</hi> as the worker and maker of it; and as of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øo al≈øo of the Son, who is the ≈øame ≈øub≈øtance with the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 30. And by whom like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe all things were made, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Mary</hi> was thus the Mother of Chri≈øt, is evident both by the Text, and al≈øo by that which goes before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 18. and that which followes after, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 22, 23, 24, 25. ≈øo by that <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It may be objected, that <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> is called
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:111827:73"/> Chri≈øts Father; <hi>Is not this</hi> Jo≈øephs <hi>Son?</hi> ≈øaid ≈øome of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I an≈øwer: They ≈øuppo≈øed ≈øo, but it was not ≈øo as they ≈øuppo≈øed: That this was but a ≈øuppo≈øition, S. <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øhewes in the fore-going Chapter, v. 23. where he ≈øaith that Chri≈øt was (<hi>as was ≈øuppo≈øed) the Son of</hi> Io≈øeph, not ≈øo indeed, but only as was ≈øuppo≈øed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But may ≈øome ≈øay, <hi>Mary</hi> her ≈øelf did call <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> Chri≈øts Father; <hi>Thy Father and I have ≈øought thee ≈øorrowing,</hi> ≈øaid ≈øhe to Chri≈øt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 48.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> True; but how did ≈øhe mean that <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> was his father? not his naturall father that begot him, but his legall father, as being the hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his mother: <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> al≈øo was Chri≈øts fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter-father, or nur≈øing-father, he who did educate him and bring him up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ≈øome may yet object, if <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> were not Chri≈øts naturall Father, how is Chri≈øts Genealogie fetched from <hi>Io≈øeph?</hi> how is Chri≈øt ≈øhewed to be the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> by this, that <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> did de≈øcend from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> To this it is an≈øwered, That <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> were both of one Tribe and of one Family, by vertue of that Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 36. 8. where it is required, that every woman being an inheritre≈ø≈øe, ≈øhould marrie to one of her own Tribe and Family, that ≈øo inheritances might not pa≈ø≈øe from one Tribe or Family to another: And therefore the rehear≈øing of Chri≈øts Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:111827:73"/> by <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> was a rehear≈øing of it by <hi>Mary,</hi> it being ≈øhewed that <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> was of the po≈øterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> the ≈øame was con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ≈øhewed concerning <hi>Mary,</hi> who by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Law fore-mentioned was married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and ≈øo it followes that Chri≈øt al≈øo by that rehear≈øall is demon≈øtrated to de≈øcend from <hi>Abraham</hi> and from <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Some may yet object, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is called <hi>Maries</hi> Kin≈øwoman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 36. Now <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> was of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Levi, Luk.</hi> 1. 5. whereas <hi>David</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ≈øo Chri≈øt who de≈øcended from <hi>David, Heb.</hi> 7. 14. How then did <hi>Mary</hi> de≈øcend from <hi>David,</hi> and not rather from <hi>Aaron</hi> as <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> her kin≈øwoman did?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It doth not follow, that becau≈øe <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> was of the daughters of <hi>Aaron,</hi> therefore <hi>Mary</hi> being her kin≈øwoman was ≈øo too: For though ≈øuch women as had no brethren, and ≈øo had inheritances, were to marrie in their owne Tribe and Family, yet others were not tied to this. The men of <hi>Benjamin</hi> did marrie women that were of other Tribes, as we read <hi>Iudges</hi> 21. And had it not been lawfull for them to marry in that manner, what needed that Oath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Iudg. 21. 1.? why ≈øhould the other Tribes ≈øwear (as they did) that they would not give their daughters to the Benjamites, if it were not lawfull for tho≈øe of one Tribe to marry with tho≈øe of another Tribe? So 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 11. it's ≈øaid, that <hi>Ieho≈øhabeath</hi> the daughter of King <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> was wife to <hi>Iehojada</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:111827:74"/> the Prie≈øt, who was of the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might be of <hi>Levi</hi> and of <hi>Aaron</hi> by the fathers ≈øide, and of <hi>Judah</hi> and of <hi>David</hi> by the mothers ≈øide, and ≈øo by her mother be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to <hi>Mary.</hi>

Finally, here we may ≈øee the wonderfull love of God, and of Chri≈øt towards us, that rather then we ≈øhould receive the ju≈øt recompence and reward of our ≈øins, God would give his own Son, and Chri≈øt would give him≈øelf to ≈øuffer for us. <hi>God ≈øo loved the world, that he gave his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ≈øon, that who≈øoever believeth in him, ≈øhould not peri≈øh, but have everla≈øting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. <hi>In this was manife≈øted the love of God towards us,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:111827:87"/> to love us, but to hate and abhor us. <hi>God commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his love towards us, in that whiles we were yet ≈øinners, Christ died for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us, and ≈øent his ≈øon into the world for us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 10. He adds v. 19. <hi>We love him, becau≈øe he loved us fir≈øt.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to do ≈øo, but ≈øo as to te≈øtifie our love by our obedience. <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandements,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandements,</hi> Joh. 14. 15. And as ≈øuch was the love of God and of Chri≈øt towards us, ≈øo we accordingly ought to love one another, <hi>If God ≈øo loved us, we ought al≈øo to love one another,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 11. <hi>Walk in love, as Christ al≈øo loved us, and gave him≈øelf for us,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>THe Apo≈øtle exhorting unto unity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, v. 1, &amp; 2. as a means conducing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he exhorts unto humility and lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of mind, v. 3. &amp; 4.

            <p>Having ≈øhewed how Chri≈øt humbled him≈øelf in being made man, he ≈øhewes how he humbled him≈øelf when he was made man, <hi>viz.</hi> ≈øo as to be <hi>obedient unto death, even the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Being found in fa≈øhion as a man,</hi>] This doth not import that Chri≈øt only had the ≈øhape and form of a man but was not man indeed, as ≈øome
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:111827:88"/> Heretikes have maintained: <hi>Every Spirit that confe≈ø≈øeth not that Je≈øus Chri≈øt is come in the fle≈øh,</hi> (is true man, having true humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>is not of God,</hi> 1 The≈ø. 4. 3. This particle <hi>as</hi> is not alwaies a meer note of ≈øimilitude, but ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is u≈øed to ≈øet forth the truth of a thing, as Joh. 1. 14. <hi>The Word was made fle≈øh, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>as the glory, &amp;c.</hi> imports that the glory of Chri≈øt, which S. <hi>John</hi> ≈øpeaks of, was indeed the very glory of the only begotten Son of God. So <hi>Philem.</hi> v. 9. <hi>being ≈øuch a one as</hi> Paul <hi>the aged,</hi> ≈øaies <hi>Paul</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf; it is therefore as much as if he had ≈øaid, <hi>being</hi> Paul <hi>the aged.</hi> So likewi≈øe Mat. 14. 5. <hi>They counted him as a Prophet,</hi> it is ≈øpoken concerning <hi>John Bapti≈øt,</hi> and the meaning is, <hi>they counted him indeed a Prophet,</hi> as his Father <hi>Zacharias</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of him when he was newly born, ≈øaying, <hi>And thou child ≈øhalt be called the Prophet of the highe≈øt, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 1. 76.

            <p>The ≈øcope of the Apo≈øtle is to ≈øhew how low Chri≈øt did humble him≈øelfe: 1. Unto death. 2. Such a kind of death, even the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt therefore ob≈øerve from hence, <hi>That Chri≈øt</hi>

               <hi>was obedient unto death:</hi> where three things are to be ≈øhewed, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That Chri≈øt did ≈øuffer death. And 2. That it was the will of God, that Chri≈øt ≈øhould ≈øuffer death. And 3. That Chri≈øt in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:111827:89"/> to the will of God did ≈øuffer death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chri≈øt did ≈øuffer death: So all the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øts record, and ≈øo S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3.

And v. 12. <hi>He hath powred out his ≈øoul unto death.</hi> Chri≈øts death al≈øo was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in the Law, which was given by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtery of <hi>Mo≈øes:</hi> all the ≈øacrifices were figures of Chri≈øts death, therefore he is called the <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the ≈øin of the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. All the Lambs (and ≈øo other bea≈øts) that were ≈øacrificed in the time of the Law, did typifie and prefigure Chri≈øt, who as a Lamb was to be ≈ølaine and ≈øacrificed for us. The Author of the Epi≈øtle to the Hebrewes ≈øhews Chri≈øt in this among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to have differed from the Prie≈øts that vvere in the Law, that whereas they offered of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Chri≈øt offered but once, and that becau≈øe he offered him≈øelf his offering was his ≈øuffering, ≈øo that if he ≈øhould have offered often, he mu≈øt al≈øo have died often, whereas men u≈øe to die but once, and ≈øo was Chri≈øt to die, but not oft'ner. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But it may be objected, that ≈øome places of the Old Te≈øtament ≈øpeaking of Chri≈øt, ≈øeem to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:111827:89"/> import that he ≈øhould not die: <hi>Thou art a Prie≈øt for ever, &amp;c.</hi> P≈øal. 110. 4. <hi>His dominion is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting dominion, &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 7. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Indeed ≈øome from tho≈øe and the like places did inferre that Chri≈øt ≈øhould not die: For when they heard Chri≈øt ≈øpeak of his death, they objected again≈øt it, ≈øaying, <hi>We have heard out of the Law, that Chri≈øt abideth for ever,</hi> Joh. 12. 34. As if becau≈øe he ≈øhould abide for ever, as was ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the <note n="*" place="margin">The Law is ≈øometimes put for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Old Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Joh. 15. 25. and 1 Cor. 14. 21.</note> Law, that is in the writings of the Old Te≈øtament, therfore he ≈øhould not die; but they erred, not rightly under≈øtanding the Scriptures which ≈øpeak of Chri≈øts abiding for ever. For the meaning of them is not, that Chri≈øt ≈øhould not die, but that although he did die, yet he ≈øhould ≈øoon ri≈øe again, and ≈øo abide for ever: <hi>Chri≈øt being ri≈øen from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him,</hi> Rom. 6. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was the will of God that Chri≈øt ≈øhould ≈øuffer death: There is nothing what≈øoever comes to pa≈ø≈øe but by the will of God; <hi>Who hath ≈øaid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nihil fit ni≈øi omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potens fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri velit, vel ip≈øe faciendo, vel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittendo ut fiat ab aliis. Aug.</note> 
               <hi>and it cometh to pa≈ø≈øe, and the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> Lam. 3. 37. otherwi≈øe then by the will and plea≈øure of God not ≈øo much as a ≈øparrow doth fall to the ground, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 29. much le≈ø≈øe could ≈øo great a thing as Chri≈øts death have been, had it not been the will and plea≈øure of God that it ≈øhould be. <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned Chri≈øt to die, and others did execute the ≈øentence which <hi>Pilate</hi> had pronounced; but neither <hi>Pilate</hi> nor others did any thing to Chri≈øt, but as God had before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be done, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27, 28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It being the will of God, that Chri≈øt ≈øhould
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:111827:90"/> ≈øuffer death, Chri≈øt in obedience to the will of God did ≈øuffer it: <hi>This Commandement have I received of my Father,</hi> ≈øaid Chri≈øt, <hi>Joh. 10. 18. viz.</hi> that he ≈øhould lay down his life, and therefore he would and did lay it down. And <hi>Joh. 18. 11.

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But why would God have Chri≈øt to ≈øuffer death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. For the ≈øatisfying of his Ju≈øtice: God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined &amp; declared death to be the puni≈øhment that ≈øhould be inflicted for ≈øin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. &amp; 3. 19. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>.</hi> 6. 33. Chri≈øt was to ≈øatisfie for ≈øin, and therefore he was to ≈øuffer death. <hi>His ≈øoul was made an offering for ≈øin,</hi> E≈øa. 53. 10. <hi>Without ≈øhedding of blood is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion,</hi> Heb. 9. 22. And v. 26. <hi>He appeared to put away ≈øin by the ≈øacrifice of him≈øelf.</hi> Thus <hi>Chri≈øt died for our ≈øins, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 3. 2. God would have Chri≈øt to ≈øuffer death, for the magnifying of his mercy. <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love towards us,</hi> (≈øets it out in this) <hi>that whiles we were yet ≈øinners, Christ died for us,</hi> Ro. 5. 8.</p>
            <p>By Chri≈øts death, fir≈øt, we are reconciled unto God: <hi>When we were enemies we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. <hi>In whom we have redemption thorough his blood, even the forgivene≈øs of our ≈øins, Col.</hi> 1. 14. And v. 21, &amp; 22. <hi>And you that were ≈øometimes alienated, and enemies in your mind thorough wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his fle≈øh through death.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:111827:90"/>
            <p>2. VVe are delivered from Satan. <hi>Now ≈øhall the Prince of this world be ca≈øt out,</hi> ≈øaid Chri≈øt, when the time of his death was at hand, <hi>Joh. 12. 31. For a≈ømuch as the children are partakers of fle≈øh and blood, he al≈øo him≈øelfe took part of the ≈øame, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough death he might de≈øtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devill,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. The devill is there ≈øaid to have the power of death (though that properly belong unto God; for it is <hi>he that killeth, and he that maketh alive,</hi> 1 Sam. 26. Deut. 32. 39.) becau≈øe by the malice of the devill man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came guilty of ≈øin, and ≈øo liable unto death. Chri≈øt by his death hath vanqui≈øhed Satan, and freed tho≈øe that belong unto him from Satans power. Therefore they that believe in Chri≈øt, are ≈øaid to be brought <hi>from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Act. 26. 18. and to be <hi>delivered from the power of darkne≈ø≈øe,</hi> Col. 1. 13.</p>
            <p>3. We have right unto eternall life. Had not Chri≈øt died, we had been uncapable of life, that life which is to come. This was ≈øignified by that <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. where it is ≈øaid, that <hi>Adam</hi> having ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>God drove him out</hi> (viz. of Paradi≈øe) <hi>and he placed at the Ea≈øt of the garden of Eden, Cherubins, and a flaming ≈øword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life.</hi> By rea≈øon of ≈øin the life to come, eternall life (which was ≈øhadowed by that tree of life) was inacce≈ø≈øible unto us, we could have no acce≈ø≈øe unto it; but Chri≈øt by his blood hath made <hi>a new and living way for us,</hi> Heb. 10. 20. <hi>And for this cau≈øe he is the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the new Te≈øtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:111827:91"/> were the first Te≈øtament, they which are called might receive the promi≈øe of eternall inheritance,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. And in the two ver≈øes following is ≈øhewed, why the new Covenant that God hath made with his people, is called a Te≈øtament, becau≈øe it is of force by Chri≈øts death. <hi>For where a Te≈øtament is, there mu≈øt al≈øo of nece≈ø≈øity be the death of the testator. For a Te≈øtament is of force after men are dead, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe it is of no ≈øtrength at all, whiles the te≈øtator li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi> Neither doth this make for the Popi≈øh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> as if before Chri≈øts death none did go to heaven, and enjoy the happine≈ø≈øe of the life to come: <hi>For Je≈øus Chri≈øt ye≈øterday, and to day, and the ≈øame for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. The death of Chri≈øt was of force, as well before, as ≈øince Chri≈øts coming; they that did believe in Chri≈øt to come, did enjoy the benefit of his death, as well as they that now ≈øince his coming do believe in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But may ≈øome ≈øay, notwith≈øtanding Chri≈øts death, yet ≈øtill all die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> True, but not ≈øo as otherwi≈øe, had it not been for Chri≈øts death, they ≈øhould have died. For 1. By the death of Chri≈øt all that believe, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether freed from the ≈øecond death; <hi>over ≈øuch the ≈øecond death hath no power,</hi> Revel. 20. 6.</p>
            <p>2. The fir≈øt death to believers is as no death, but an entrance into life, even life eternall. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are the dead which die in our Lord, from henceforth, yea ≈øaith the Spirit, that they may rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> &amp;c. Revel. 14. 13. The ≈øouls of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full being ≈øeparated from their bodies, do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enter into happine≈ø≈øe, which made the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle

And the bodies of believers ≈øhall al≈øo in due time be rai≈øed up, and together with their ≈øouls be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of eternall bli≈ø≈øe. Chri≈øt by his death hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome death, ≈øo that they that believe in him ≈øhall not be overcome by it, not ≈øo as for ever to remain under the power and dominion of it. <hi>I will ran≈øome them from the power of the grave,</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt) <hi>I wil redeem them from death: O death I will by thy plagues; O grave I will be thy de≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Ho≈ø. 13. 14.

            </epigraph>
            <p>THus the Apo≈øtle ≈øhews the greatne≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øts humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and obedience, in that he not only humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and was obedient unto death, but ≈øuch a kind of death, <hi>even the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe,</hi> that is, death on the Cro≈ø≈øe; he was crucified, nailed alive to the Cro≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo did hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cro≈ø≈øe untill he died. This point then offers it ≈øelf to be con≈øidered, That Chri≈øt was obedient even to the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this point I ≈øhall ≈øhew. 1. That Chri≈øt ≈øuffered death on the Cro≈ø≈øe. 2. That this was a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Chri≈øts ≈øuffering. 3. What u≈øe is to be made of the point.</p>
            <p>For the fir≈øt, That Chri≈øt ≈øuffered death upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, it is a thing clearly recorded by all the foure Evangeli≈øts, So <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epi≈øtles often ≈øpeaks of the Cro≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt (that is, of Chri≈øts death on the Cro≈ø≈øe) and of Chri≈øt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. See 1 Cor. 1. 18. 23. &amp; 2. 2. 8. Gal. 6. 14. Phil. 3. 18. So <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øaith, that <hi>Chri≈øt bare our ≈øins on his body on the tree,</hi> that is, on the Cro≈ø≈øe, 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>David</hi> al≈øo prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of this, ≈øaying, <hi>They pierced my hands, and my feet,</hi> P≈øal. 22. 16. He ≈øpake tho≈øe words prophetically in the per≈øon of Chri≈øt; as the very beginning of the P≈øalm doth ≈øhew, <hi>My God, My God, why ha≈øt thou for≈øaken me?</hi> which words (as the Evangeli≈øts record) Chri≈øt uttered, when he was upon the Cro≈ø≈øe. So v. 18. <hi>They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my ve≈øture.</hi> Which (as appears likewi≈øe by the hi≈øtory of the Go≈øpell) was fulfilled in Chri≈øt, when he was crucified.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:111827:94"/>
            <p>Chri≈øt al≈øo him≈øelf did foretell what kind of death he ≈øhould ≈øuffer, to wit, the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe. <hi>Behold</hi> (≈øaid he to his Di≈øciples) <hi>We go up to Jeru≈øalem, and the Son of man ≈øhall be betrayed unto the chief Priests, and to the Scribes, and they ≈øhall condemn him to death. And they ≈øhall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to ≈øcourge, and to crucifie him.</hi> Mat. 20. 18, 19. So Joh. 12. 32, 33. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.</hi> That by his <hi>lifting up</hi> he meant lifting up upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, to die upon it, the Evangeli≈øt immediately declares, ≈øaying, <hi>This he ≈øaid, ≈øignifying what death he ≈øhould die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chri≈øts death upon the Cro≈ø≈øe was likewi≈øe typified, and prefigured by the brazen Serpent, of which we read, <hi>Num.</hi> 21. There the ≈øacred hi≈øtory tells us how God when the I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ≈øinned again≈øt God, and provoked him by murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he plagued them by ≈øending fiery Serpents among them; but in wrath remembring mercy, he commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> to ≈øet upon a pole a brazen Serpent (the ≈øimilitude of a ≈øerpent made of bra≈ø≈øe) that who≈øoever was ≈øtung by a fiery ≈øerpent, by looking up to that brazen ≈øerpent might be made whole: This brazen ≈øerpent ≈øo lifted up, was a type and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chri≈øt lifted up upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, that who≈øoever are ≈øtung by that old ≈øerpent the devill, may look up to him with the eye of faith, and be ≈øaved. This Chri≈øt him≈øelf doth ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie unto us, ≈øaying, <hi>As Mo≈øes lift up the Serpent in the wilderne≈ø≈øe, ≈øo mu≈øt the Son of man be lifted up, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever believeth in him, ≈øhould not peri≈øh, but have everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But it may be objected, that among the Jews this kind of death was not in u≈øe. The Iewi≈øh Talmud tells us, that<note place="margin">Sanhedr. c. 7.</note> they had foure kinds of capitall puni≈øhments, to wit, ≈øtoning, burning, killing with the ≈øword, and ≈øtrangling. They make no mention of crucifying; neither do we find it mentioned any where in the old Te≈øtament. There indeed we read of hanging, but it was not a hanging of any while≈øt they were alive, but only a hanging of them after that they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe put to death, to wit, for the greater infamy of tho≈øe who were hanged, and for the greater terrour of others. <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> fir≈øt ≈ømote and ≈ølew the five Kings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them upon trees untill evening; for by the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:111827:94"/> 23. none were to hang longer, <hi>Jo≈ø.</hi> 10. 26. This hanging was quite another thing much different from crucifying. For they that were crucified were hanged alive, being nailed to a cro≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo did hang untill they were dead. It's ≈øaid indeed that the Iews ≈ølew Chri≈øt, and hanged him on a tree, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 30. &amp; 10. 39. But that is not ≈øo to be under≈øtood, as if they did fir≈øt ≈ølay him, and then hang him on a tree, that had not been crucifying; neither doth that agree with the ≈øacred hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory of the Go≈øpell. The meaning of tho≈øe places is, that they ≈ølew him by hanging him on a tree. The particle <hi>and</hi> in tho≈øe places is exegeticall or explicative rather then copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it ≈øhews how they flew him, to wit ≈øo, as that they hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him on a tree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Some of the Iewi≈øh Rabbines indeed think by this argument (to wit that crucifying, or putting to death by hanging upon a Cro≈ø≈øe, was not u≈øed among the Iews) they think (I ≈øay) to convince the Go≈øpell of fal≈øhood<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but they bewray either their ignorance or malice, or both. For in the<note place="margin">

               </note> time of our Saviour, and ≈øome while before, the Iews were under the power and juri≈ødiction of the Romanes, as appears not only by the new Te≈øtament, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 1. 4, 5. &amp; 3. 1. and ≈øo other places; but al≈øo by forraign Writers, as <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> a Iew, and <hi>Tacitus</hi> a heathen man. Now crucifying was a puni≈øhment, which was much u≈øed among the Romanes; and they brought it into u≈øe among the Iews, when they had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them.

So it was, as the Evangeli≈øts relate. Pilate <hi>willing to content the people, relea≈øed</hi> Barabbas <hi>unto them, and delivered Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, when he had ≈øcourged him, to be crucified. And the ≈øouldiers led him away, &amp;c. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe from him, and put his own
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:111827:95"/> clothes on him, and led him out to crucifie him,</hi> Mar. 15. 15, 16, 20. S. <hi>John</hi> al≈øo having ≈øaid, that <hi>Pilate</hi> bade the Iews take Chri≈øt, and judge him according to their Law, and that the Iews an≈øwered, that it was not lawfull for them to put any man to death; he addes, <hi>That the ≈øaying of Je≈øus might be fulfilled, which he ≈øpake, ≈øignifying what death he ≈øhould die,</hi> Joh. 18. 31, 32. Chri≈øt had ≈øignified, that he ≈øhould die the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe, which was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by the Iewes delivering of Chri≈øt unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> who being a Roman, condemned him to that kind of death, which was in u≈øe among the Romans: <hi>Peter</hi> indeed told the Jewes, that they had crucified Chri≈øt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 22, 23. 36. &amp; 5, 30. But that was becau≈øe it was done thorough their in≈øtigation. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. And <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15. the Jewes are ju≈øtly charged with it, becau≈øe they were the workers and procurers of it. Thus then the objection is ≈øufficiently an≈øwered, and the fir≈øt thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded is ≈øufficiently cleared, to wit, that Chri≈øt ≈øuffered death on the Cro≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>2. The next thing to be con≈øidered is, that this was a great aggravation of Chri≈øts ≈øuffering: The Apo≈øtle (we ≈øee in the Text) aggravates his ≈øuffering by this, that he not only ≈øuffered death, but <hi>even the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe.</hi> This death was more grievous then other kinds of death in divers re≈øpects: For, fir≈øt, it was a more painfull death;<note place="margin">

               <hi>He indured the Cro≈ø≈øe:</hi> So it is ≈øaid of Chri≈øt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. which intimates that the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe was very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and hard to be indured. It is grievous to indure any death that is violent, but e≈øpecially the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe; to have the hands and the feet (which by rea≈øon of the multitude of ≈øinewes, are of all parts mo≈øt ≈øen≈øible of pain) pierced thorough with nails, yea digged, as the word u≈øed <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 22. 16. doth indeed ≈øignifie, and ≈øo to be fa≈øtened to a Cro≈ø≈øe, and to hang for many hours together, this mu≈øt needs be very dolourus and painfull: The Latine word for a Cro≈ø≈øe comes of a word that ≈øignifieth torment, of all puni≈øhments that of the Cro≈ø≈øe was accounted mo≈øt bitter and mo≈øt tormenting.

Chri≈øt being crucified for us, <hi>hath blotted out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was against us, which was contrary unto us, and hath taken it out of the way, nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it unto his Cro≈ø≈øe.

            <p>This is recorded by all the Evangeli≈øts; and it was al≈øo long before ≈øpoken of by the Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah, And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death,</hi> E≈øa. 53. 9.

Thus they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to deal with tho≈øe that were crucified, as they relate who are ver≈øed in the Antiquities of the Romanes, among whom crucifying was in u≈øe, and ≈øo (as before was ≈øhewed) they having dominion over the Jews, by that means it was that Chri≈øt was crucified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I an≈øwer, that although that were the cu≈øtome of the Romanes not to permit tho≈øe whom they did crucifie to be buried, yet they were ≈øo indulgent to the Jews as to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to ob≈øerve their owne Lawes which God pre≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto them. Now one Law which the Jewes were to ob≈øerve, was this, that if any were hanged on a tree, he ≈øhould not hang all night, but be taken down at even, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. And ≈øo S. <hi>John</hi> relates, that the Jewes came to <hi>Pilate</hi> and de≈øired him <hi>that the bodies</hi> (of Chri≈øt, and the other that were crucified with him) <hi>might not remain on the Cro≈ø≈øe on the Sabbath day,</hi> which was the day after they were crucified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 31. There was then more e≈øpeciall cau≈øe why they de≈øired to have the bodies taken down, becau≈øe be≈øides that Law in <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> before mentioned, the day after was the Sabbath day, and an extraordinary Sabbath (as it is there ≈øaid, <hi>for that Sabbath day was an high day</hi>) by rea≈øon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:111827:98"/> of the fea≈øt of the Pa≈ø≈øeover, which al≈øo was at that time. But by this place of the Evangeli≈øt we may ≈øee that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were not ≈øo ≈øtrict with the Jewes, but that they would let them injoy their liberty in things that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their Religion. And moreover the Evangeli≈øts ≈øhew that there was ≈øpeciall leave given by <hi>Pilate</hi> the Romane Governour for Chri≈øts buriall, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 38. And the like may be ≈øeen in the other Evangeli≈øts.</p>
            <p>It was meet that Chri≈øt ≈øhould be buried: Fir≈øt, for the greater certainty of his death, that it might the better appear that he was dead indeed, and not in appearance only; for none u≈øe to be buried, but ≈øuch as are fir≈øt dead: And <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> was very carefull to be certified fir≈øt of Chri≈øts death, before he would give leave that he ≈øhould be buried, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15. 43, 44, 45.</p>
            <p>2.

            <p>And again, the Evangeli≈øts record that Chri≈øt was laid in a ≈øepulchre which was hewen out of a Rock, and that a great ≈øtone was rolled to the door of the ≈øepulchre, and that the ≈øtone vvas ≈øealed, and a watch ≈øet to keep the ≈øepulchre, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 60, 66. So that it could not with any probability be pretended that either by undermining or otherwi≈øe, Chri≈øt was ≈øtolne out of the ≈øepulchre.</p>
            <p>3. Chri≈øts burial was a further degree of his humiliation: It was much for him to die, and more to die the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe, and yet more to conde≈øcend and ≈øtoop ≈øo low, as to be laid in the grave the common receptacle of the dead. <hi>Job</hi> ≈øpeaking of a man that is high and eminent in the world vvhile he liveth, ≈øhevves that yet vvhen he dieth he

Yet ≈øhall he be brought to the grave, and ≈øhal remain in the tomb, the clods of the valley ≈øhall be ≈øweet unto him,</hi> &amp;c. Iob 21. 31, 32, 33.</p>
            <p>4. This ≈øerved to make Chri≈øts victory over death, &amp; <hi>over him that had the power of death,</hi> that is, the Devill, the more glorious; that he not only died, but al≈øo was buried; death ≈øeemed to have ful conque≈øt over Chri≈øt, having gotten him into its den, yet even there did Chri≈øt vanqui≈øh and ≈øubdue it: Thus did he mo≈øt gloriou≈øly triumph, fulfilling that, <hi>O death, I will be thy plague, O grave, I will be thy de≈øtruction,</hi> Ho≈ø. 13. 14.</p>

But we mu≈øt not think that whiles we are here, we can be ≈øo conformed unto Chri≈øt, ≈øo dead and buried with him as to be without ≈øin, to be quite free from it. No, <hi>If we ≈øay that we have no ≈øin, we deceive our ≈øelves</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 8. <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> Iam. 3. 2.

            <p>Again, there is not the like rea≈øon of ≈øpirituall death and buriall, and of that which it corporall. For corporal death and buriall is fini≈øhed at once; but not ≈øo that which is ≈øpirituall; this is done by degrees, by little and little: He that is already dead and buried in a ≈øpirituall ≈øen≈øe, that is, he who≈øe old man, who≈øe imbred corruption is as it were put to death, and laid in the grave, yet mu≈øt ≈øtill die in that kind, and be buried ≈øtill more and more, becau≈øe he hath ≈øtill ≈øome reliques of the old man, ≈øtill ≈øome ≈øin and corruption remains in him.

               <hi>V≈øe</hi> 4. In the la≈øt place, the doctrine of Chri≈øts
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:111827:101"/> burying may ≈øerve for our information. As 1. That it is a Chri≈øtian cour≈øe to bury the dead: Nature it ≈øelf doth teach ≈øo much, and much more Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that the dead ought to be buried. The Saints have ≈øhewed a ≈øpeciall care to perform their duty in this re≈øpect. <hi>Sarah</hi> being dead, <hi>Abraham</hi> was very carefull to have her buried. <hi>I am a ≈øtranger and a ≈øojourner with you</hi> (≈øaid he to the Hittites) <hi>give me a po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my ≈øight,</hi> Gen. 23. 4. And it is ob≈øervable, that he purcha≈øed nothing in the Land of Canaan, but only the place there ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of to bury in. So <hi>Stephen</hi> being ≈øtoned to death, <hi>devout men carried him to be buried,</hi> Act. 8. 2. It's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of <hi>I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>I≈ømael,</hi> that when <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father was dead, they buried him, Gen. 25. 9. And ≈øo of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>E≈øau,</hi> that they did the ≈øame for <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> Gen. 35. 29. Though <hi>I≈ømael</hi> and <hi>E≈øau</hi> were prophane per≈øons (Gal. 4. 29. Heb. 12. 16.) yet they joyned with <hi>I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who were godly, in the burying of their Father: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which we read in the Go≈øpell, that when Chri≈øt called one to follow him, and he de≈øired fir≈øt to go and bury his Father, Chri≈øt ≈øaid, <hi>Let the dead bury the dead;</hi> That, I ≈øay, is not ≈øo to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as if Chri≈øt did condemn, or vilifie the office of burying the dead, as if this care did not become the godly. For (as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith in another<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:111827:101"/> and nothing mu≈øt hinder us from following Chri≈øt, when he doth call, nor from doing that which he doth enjoyn. How far Chri≈øt was from intending to di≈øparage the office of burying the dead, may appear by that which he ≈øpake in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Mary,</hi> whom ≈øome excepted again≈øt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of the precious ointment that ≈øhe had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon him, ≈øaying, that it might better have been ≈øold, and the money given to the poor, <hi>Let her alone</hi> (≈øaid Chri≈øt) <hi>for again≈øt the day of my burying hath ≈øhe done this,</hi> Joh. 12. 7. They are therefore inhumane, who not content with the death of tho≈øe whom they hate and per≈øecute, wil not ≈øuffer them to be buried, or not to re≈øt when they are buried. This indeed is a puni≈øhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced again≈øt, and inflicted upon ≈øome for the example of others. <hi>He ≈øhall be buried with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of an a≈ø≈øe, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jeru≈øalem,</hi> Jer. 22. 19. <hi>Their dead bodies ≈øhal be for meat to the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth,</hi> Jer. 32. 20. <hi>And as</hi> Jo≈øiah <hi>turned him≈øelf, he e≈øpied the Sepulchers that were there in the mount, and he ≈øent and took the bones out of the Sepulchers, and burnt them upon the Altar, &amp;c.</hi> 2 King. 23. 16. God had long before declared, that <hi>Jo≈øiah</hi> ≈øhould thus deal with the dead bones of Idolaters, 1 Kings 13. 2. But what doth this make for them, who deal thus even with the Saints, who≈øe death is precious in the ≈øight of the Lord? This the P≈øalmi≈øt complains ≈øore of, <hi>The dead bodies of thy ≈øervants have they given to be meat to the fowls of the heavens, the fle≈øh of thy Saints unto the bea≈øts of the earth. Their blood have

Thus barbarou≈øly did they of the Romi≈øh Church here in the time of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> deal with tho≈øe worthy men <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Fagius,</hi> they digged up their dead bodies out of their graves, and con≈øumed them in the fire: and this inhumanity have ≈øome u≈øed towards the dead, out of a de≈øire to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves on them to the uttermo≈øt; as it is ≈øaid of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> that he cau≈øed the dead body of <hi>Marius</hi> his adver≈øary to be digged up.

            <p>2.

The Papi≈øts are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øuper≈øtitious in this, thinking it to concern the welfare of the ≈øoul, to be buried rather in one
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:111827:102"/> place then in another. Purgatory is the ground of this conceit, but Purgatory it ≈øelf hath no ground in Scripture for it. The Scripture tels us, that when<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 7.</note> a man dies, as the body goeth to the earth, ≈øo the ≈øoul goes to God, <hi>viz.</hi> to be judged by him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhal the ≈øoul fare better or wor≈øe, whether the body be buried or not, or buried after this, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner.

True it is, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks of old were very ≈øolicitous about their burying in the Land of Canaan, though they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 29, 30, 31, &amp; 49. 29. &amp;c. And 50. 26. But that was not out of any ≈øuper≈øtitious opinion that they had, as if the welfare of their ≈øouls did depend upon the place where they were buried, but only to ≈øhew that they died in faith, being fully a≈ø≈øured that God would at length per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he had promi≈øed, <hi>viz.</hi> that he would give them (in their po≈øterity) the Land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: <hi>God will ≈øurely vi≈øit you,</hi> ≈øaid Jo≈øeph, ≈øpeaking of this very thing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 25.

            <p>THe Article of Chri≈øts de≈øcending into hell, is grounded upon this Text, wherein as <hi>S.

Epi≈øt. 99.</note> wel ≈øay, who but an infidel wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that Chri≈øt was in hell? For this, that Chri≈øts ≈øoul ≈øhould not be left in hell, doth nece≈ø≈øarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuppo≈øe that his ≈øoul was in hell: For it is mo≈øt irrational and ab≈øurd, to ≈øay that one ≈øhall be left there, where he never was, nor ≈øhould be. All therefore (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ob≈øerves)<note place="margin">Omnes conveniunt, qu√≤d Chri≈øtus aliquo modo ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feros de≈øcenderit. Bell. de Chri≈øti anima lib. 4. cap. 6.</note> agree in this, that Chri≈øt ≈øome way, in one ≈øen≈øe or other, was in hell. But for the manner how Chri≈øt was in hell, there is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among Divines; and all ari≈øes from the word <hi>hell,</hi> which ≈øome take in one ≈øen≈øe, and ≈øome in another, I ≈øhall as briefly, and per≈øpicuou≈øly as I
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:111827:103"/> may ≈øet down the ≈øeveral opinions, that there are about this point, confuting tho≈øe which I hold to be erroneous, and confirming that which I judge to be true.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt therefore, becau≈øe the word <hi>Hell</hi> is ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<note place="margin">The fir≈øt opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Chri≈øts de≈øcending into hell.</note> in Scripture u≈øed metaphorically, for mo≈øt great &amp; grievous affliction, which is indured here in this life, (<hi>the ≈øorrows of hell compa≈ø≈øed me about,</hi> ≈øaies <hi>David,</hi> P≈øal. 18. 5. So P≈øal. 116. 3. <hi>The pains of hell got hold on me.</hi>) Some by Chri≈øts de≈øcending into hell ≈øpoken of in the Creed, under≈øtand the inward ≈øufferings of Chri≈øts ≈øoul, which of all his ≈øufferings were mo≈øt grievous. But to omit other arguments again≈øt this opinion, it is ≈øufficiently overthrown by this, that the≈øe words of <hi>David (Thou wilt not leave my ≈øoul in hell)</hi> as cited and expounded by <hi>Peter</hi> in the ≈øecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> are the ground of that Article in the Creed; for el≈øe it hath no ground in Scripture, as I think I am ≈øure, there is no place which doth ≈øo clearly hold out unto us by nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence Chri≈øts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in hell, as this doth. And therefore though <hi>Calvin,</hi> (a prime Author of this fir≈øt opinion, and a man mo≈øt de≈øervedly renowned in the Church of God) ≈øpake con≈øentaneou≈øly to his opinion, when in his Commentary upon this ≈øixteenth P≈øalm, he liked not that upon occa≈øion of the≈øe words of <hi>David,</hi> any ≈øhould fall upon the point of Chri≈øts de≈øcending into hell, which is mentioned in the Creed, yet I can by no means a≈ø≈øent unto him. For if not the≈øe words of <hi>David</hi> which we have now in hand, no place in all the Scripture (I dare ≈øay) will afford occa≈øion to treat of the Article. But it
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:111827:104"/> appears that <hi>Calvin</hi> (being a man very acute) did well perceive that the≈øe words of <hi>David, Thou wilt not leave my ≈øoul in hell,</hi> as commented upon <hi>Act.</hi> 2. will not admit, that Chri≈øts de≈øcending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell ≈øhould be expounded of the ≈øufferings of Chri≈øts ≈øoul. For by <hi>hell</hi> in the words of <hi>David,</hi> mu≈øt needs be meant ≈øomething that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Chri≈øt when he was dead: <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that in tho≈øe words (<hi>Thou wilt not leave my ≈øoul in hell</hi>) David <hi>≈øpake of the Re≈øurrection of Chri≈øt,</hi> Act. 2. 31. Now if this, that Chri≈øts ≈øoul ≈øhould not be left in hell, import that Chri≈øt ≈øhould ri≈øe from the dead, then it mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily follow, that Chri≈øts being in hell, which is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Davids</hi> words, imports ≈øomething that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him being dead: And con≈øequently the ≈øufferings of Chri≈øts ≈øoul, which were before his death, cannot be meant by it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Papi≈øts take hell here for <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> 
               <hi>Patrum,</hi> as they call it, a place where they ≈øay the ≈øouls of the godly that died before Chri≈øt, were. For they divide hell into four ≈øeverall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, 1. The hell of the damned, the place of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall torment, 2. Purgatory, where they ≈øay the ≈øouls of ≈øuch are as were not ≈øufficiently purged from their ≈øins, whiles they were upon earth, and therefore for the thorough purging of them, are there in torment equall for the time to that of the damned, 3. <hi>Limbus Infantium,</hi> a place where they place ≈øuch Infants as die without bapti≈øme, whom they make to ≈øuffer the lo≈ø≈øe of heaven and heavenly happine≈ø≈øe, but no pain or torment, 4. <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> where in like manner the Fathers
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:111827:104"/> before Chri≈øt (as they hold) were, ≈øuffering no pain, but only wanting the joys of heaven. To that place (≈øay they) did Chri≈øts ≈øoul when it was ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his body, de≈øcend, to deliver the ≈øouls from thence, and to carry them to heaven; this is their opinion, and their expo≈øition of the Article of Chri≈øts de≈øcending into hell.</p>
            <p>But not now to conte≈øt with them about tho≈øe other regions of hell, <hi>viz.</hi> Purgatory and <hi>Limbus Infantium,</hi> as for this <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> it is a place of their own devi≈øing, we ≈øee no ground for it in Scripture, but ≈øtrong rea≈øons again≈øt it. For 1. Chri≈øts death was efficacious to believers before his coming, as well as it is now ≈øince his coming. <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt ye≈øterday, and to day, and the ≈øame for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. <hi>We believe that thorough the grace of our Lord Je≈øus Christ, we ≈øhall be ≈øaved even as they,</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Peter,</hi> ≈øpeaking of tho≈øe that were before Chri≈øt. He doth but equall us to them in point of ≈øalvation thorough Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>2. The faithfull before Chri≈øt did account this life upon earth a pilgrimage, and did expect hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as their country, when this life was ended. <hi>The≈øe all died in faith</hi> (it is ≈øpoken of <hi>Abraham I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob) having not received the promi≈øes</hi> (that is, the things promi≈øed) <hi>but ≈øaw them afar off, and were per≈øwaded of them, and embraced them, and confe≈ø≈øed that they were ≈øtrangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that ≈øay ≈øuch things, declare plainly that they ≈øeek a Countrey. And truly if they had been mindfull of that country, from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they de≈øire a better country, that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:111827:105"/> is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not a≈øhamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a City,</hi> Heb. 11. 11. 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo≈øome (as the place is called, where the ≈øouls of the godly were before Chri≈øt) could be no ≈øuch place as that which they call <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi> For 1. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Angels, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22.

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> They object that <hi>Gen. 37. 53. I will go down to the grave</hi> (to hell, as they read it) <hi>to my Son,</hi> &amp;c. Thus ≈øpake <hi>Iacob</hi> concerning his ≈øon <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> when his brethren had ≈øold him, and made <hi>Jacob</hi> believe that ≈øome wild bea≈øt had devoured him. The Hebrew word there u≈øed viz. <hi>Sheol,</hi> which we ≈øometimes tran≈ølate grave, ≈øomtimes hell, they ≈øay cannot there ≈øignifie grave, but mu≈øt ≈øignifie hell, <hi>viz.</hi> that part of hell, which they call <hi>Limbus Patrum; Jacobs</hi> meaning (≈øay they) was that he would go mourning thither, whither <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeph</hi> (as he ≈øuppo≈øed) was gone before him: And they prove that the grave cannot there be meant, becau≈øe <hi>Jacob</hi> imagined <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> torne in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by ≈øome wild bea≈øt, and ≈øo not to have been buried.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> But this place makes nothing for their purpo≈øe; all that <hi>Iacob</hi> meant was, that in vain did they go about to comfort him, for he would not be comforted, but would mourn unto death, even as <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> (he thought) was dead: It's not unu≈øuall for tho≈øe that mourn for their friends

It's reported of the Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canians, that they were ≈øo barbarous, as to ca≈øt dead bodies unto doggs to be devoured: And that thereupon <hi>Diogenes</hi> u≈øed to ≈øay, that if he were torne in pieces by dogs, yet he ≈øhould have an Hyrcanian buriall; ≈øo if <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by a wild bea≈øt, the very belly of the bea≈øt had been a grave unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But again, they object likewi≈øe that Joh. 14. 2. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you;</hi> thence they infer, that before Chri≈øts a≈øcen≈øion none did go to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> But this inference is not good; for (as was ≈øhewed before) Chri≈øts death, and ≈øo his re≈øurrection and his a≈øcen≈øion was effectuall from the beginning; as by vertue of Chri≈øts death the faithfull that were before Chri≈øt, had their ≈øins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ≈øo al≈øo by vertue of his a≈øcen≈øion did they go to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But (≈øay they againe) the Scripture plainly tells us, that <hi>the way into the holie≈øt of all was not yet made manife≈øt, while as the fir≈øt Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was yet ≈øtanding;</hi> therefore during that time none did go to heaven.</p>
            <p>

            <p>3. That hell that Chri≈øt was not left in, <hi>David</hi> was left in, el≈øe S. <hi>Peter</hi> could not argue as he doth, that <hi>David</hi> in the≈øe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ≈øoule in hell,</hi> ≈øpake of Chri≈øt, and not of him≈øelfe; for that the words being under≈øtood of <hi>David</hi> are not true, but mo≈øt true as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood of Chri≈øt: <hi>Men and brethren,</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Peter</hi> to the Jews, <hi>let me freely ≈øpeak unto you of the Patriarch</hi> David, <hi>that he is both dead, buried, and his Sepulchre remaineth with us to this day; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being a Prophet, and knowing that God had ≈øworne with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loines according to the fle≈øh, he would rai≈øe up Chri≈øt to ≈øit upon his Throne; He ≈øeeing this before, ≈øpake of the Re≈øurrection of Christ, that his ≈øoul ≈øhould not be left in hell, nor his fle≈øh ≈øee corruption,</hi> Acts 2. 29, 30, 31.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:111827:108"/> the hell which he ≈øpeaks of, and therefore did not ≈øpeak of him≈øelf, but of Chri≈øt, who was not left in it. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> having cited the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following the≈øe of the Text, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not ≈øuffer thy holy one to ≈øee corruption,</hi> he al≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that this was meant of Chri≈øt, and not of <hi>David; For</hi> David (≈øaith he) <hi>after he had ≈øerved his own generation by the will of God, fell on ≈øleep, and was laid with his fathers, and ≈øaw corruption: But he whom God rai≈øed again, ≈øaw no corruption,</hi> Acts 13. 35, 36, 37. <hi>David</hi> ≈øpake not of him≈øelf, but of Chri≈øt, when he ≈øaid, <hi>Thou wilt not ≈øuffer thy holy one to ≈øee corruption,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>David</hi> did ≈øee corruption, but Chri≈øt did not ≈øee it; ≈øo <hi>David</hi> ≈øpake not of him≈øelf, but of Chri≈øt, when he ≈øaid, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ≈øoul in hell;</hi> becau≈øe <hi>Davids</hi> ≈øoul was left in hell, but Chri≈øts ≈øoul was not left in it: This is the Apo≈øtles argument, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily evinceth, that by hell here ≈øpoken of, is meant ≈øome other thing then the place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for <hi>Davids</hi> ≈øoule was not left in that hell, it never came into it; that hell belonging not to the godly and elect, but to the wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate: Therefore neither is this the hell in which (as the words imply) Chri≈øts ≈øoule was for a while, though it did not remaine there.</p>
            <p>5. This Expo≈øition of Chri≈øts de≈øcending into the hell of the damned there to triumph, makes his de≈øcending into hell a part of his exaltation; for it's ones exaltation to triumph over his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

            <p>6. It appears by Scripture, that when Chri≈øt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ≈øoul went to heaven, and therefore not to hell, as taken for the place of torment, which is mo≈øt oppo≈øite and contrary unto heaven. <hi>This day ≈øhalt thou be with me in Paradi≈øe,</hi> ≈øaid Chri≈øt to the penitent malefactour.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:111827:109"/> nature, Chri≈øt was with the thief here in this world, even then when he played the thief; ≈øo that in this ≈øen≈øe Chri≈øt in tho≈øe words (<hi>with me</hi>) had promi≈øed no new thing unto him. 2.

               <hi>Ob.</hi> But again≈øt this expo≈øition it is objected, that in the Creed Chri≈øts buriall is ≈øpoken of before, and that plainly, and therefore it is not probable that it ≈øhould be mentioned over again, and that in ≈øuch ob≈øcure words as the≈øe, <hi>he de≈øcended into hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> This objection ≈øeems to be of much force, and in this re≈øpect I am inclined to think, that the meaning of the≈øe words, <hi>he de≈øcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell,</hi> is not the ≈øame with that which went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before, <hi>and buried,</hi> but that ≈øomething
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:111827:116"/> more is ≈øignified in Chri≈øts de≈øcending into hell, then in his buriall; yet they that follow this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition do not altogether want what to an≈øwer to the Objection. For, 1. When as anciently (as before I noted) only one of the≈øe (either Chri≈øts buriall or his de≈øcending into hell) was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Creed, it might ≈øo come to pa≈ø≈øe, that afterward both were joyned together, and yet the ≈øame thing be ≈øignified by them. 2. Chri≈øts funeration or preparing for his bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be under≈øtood in the Creed by the word<note place="margin">See. B. U≈øher.</note>

If the≈øe an≈øwers do not ≈øatisfie, as I confe≈ø≈øe I am not ≈øatisfied with them, it may be ≈øaid, (and ≈øo ≈øome do interpret their meaning) that they who expound tho≈øe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my</hi>

               <hi>≈øoul in hell,</hi> ≈øo as by hell to under≈øtand the grave, do not by Chri≈øts being in hell, or de≈øcending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell ≈øimply under≈øtand his be laid in the grave, [which is his buriall] but his abiding in the ≈øtate of death, which in re≈øpect of the body, was his abiding in the grave: But this la≈øt an≈øwer falls into another Expo≈øition of Chri≈øts de≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into hell, which though it be neare a-kin to this la≈øt mentioned, yet is di≈øtinct from it.<note place="margin">The fifth Opinion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, therefore ≈øome by Chri≈øts being in hell under≈øtand his being in the ≈øtate of the dead, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:111827:116"/> under the power and dominion of death. And this I hold the be≈øt and mo≈øt genuine Expo≈øition of the≈øe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ≈øoule in hell,</hi> that is, thou wilt not leave me in the ≈øtate of the dead, or under the power of death, but wilt rai≈øe me againe from the dead. And ≈øo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently the Article of Chri≈øts de≈øcending into hell (whereof the≈øe words are the foundation) imports no more, but that Chri≈øt went into the other world, was in the ≈øtate of the dead, and under deaths dominion, to wit, untill his Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. This Expo≈øition keeps the propriety of the words, and the order of the Creed, neither is there any thing that I know of weight again≈øt it. The Hebrew word <hi>Sheol,</hi> and the Greek <hi>Hades,</hi> which are rendred ≈øometimes hell, do ≈øignifie the e≈øtate of the dead, or the power of death; <hi>Hell and de≈øtruction are before the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15. 11. <hi>Jan≈øenius</hi> a learned Writer of the Church of Rome, upon the place notes, that by hell and de≈øtruction<note place="margin">Per infernum &amp; perditionem ≈øignificatur ≈øtatus mortuorum, &amp; non ≈øolum damnatorum, ut nos fer√® ex his vocibus auditis concipimus, ≈øed in genere ≈øtatus defunctorum. <hi>Jan≈øen. ad loc.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And it is evident, that by hell there, cannot be meant the hell of the damned; for <hi>David</hi> would not make it a thing impo≈ø≈øible for any to e≈øcape that hell, as he doth make it for any to e≈øcape the hell that he ≈øpeaketh of: Therefore by <hi>hell</hi> he mu≈øt needs mean either the grave (and then the word [≈øoul] is not taken properly) or the ≈øtate of the ≈øtate of the<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> dead, from which without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary di≈øpen≈øation, none is exempted. Thus al≈øo is the Greek word <hi>Hades</hi> u≈øed, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55.

And con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Chri≈øts being in hell (which is implied in the≈øe words of <hi>David, Thou wilt not leave my ≈øoul in hell,</hi> and expre≈ø≈øed in the Creed) imports nothing els but his being under the power of death, under which he was kept for a while, though not long. So that of S. <hi>Paul, Rom. 6. 9.

            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But may ≈øome ≈øay, according to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition, there is nothing more ≈øignified in the Article of Chri≈øts de≈øcending into hell, then in the other that he died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I an≈øwer: Yes, there is more ≈øignified in the one, then in the other: For that Chri≈øt died, imports only that his ≈øoul was ≈øeparated from his bodie; but, that he de≈øcended into hell, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that his ≈øoule and bodie continued for a while in the ≈øtate of ≈øeparation, to wit, untill his Re≈øurrection, when they were again united one to the other. Such difference as there is betwixt<note place="margin">B. U≈øher.</note> birth and life here, ≈øuch al≈øo is there betwixt death and de≈øcending into hell: Death performs its work in a moment, but hell continues this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:111827:118"/> work, to wit, the ≈øeparation of the ≈øoule from the body, untill the body ri≈øing again, the ≈øoule and it are reunited together: Therefore it may ≈øeem to be ≈øaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8. that <hi>hell followed after death,</hi> and thus both ≈øoul and body are ≈øaid to be in <hi>Sheol,</hi> or <hi>Hades,</hi> or <hi>hell,</hi> while≈øt they remaine ≈øeparated one from the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But again it may be objected, that if the ≈øoul while≈øt it is in a ≈øtate of ≈øeparation from the body, be ≈øaid to be in hell, then it is in hell even when it is in heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It is granted; nor is this uncouth or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, as ≈øome may think it to be, becau≈øe of the u≈øuall ≈øen≈øe and ≈øignification wherein the word <hi>hell</hi> is taken: For as the word <hi>fle≈øh</hi> is in<note place="margin">B.

For, <hi>there is a fle≈øh of fi≈øh,</hi> 1 Cor, 15. 39. So though we u≈øually take the word <hi>hell</hi> in oppo≈øition to heaven, taking hell for the place of torment, as heaven for the place of happine≈ø≈øe; yet the word <hi>hell</hi> as an≈øwering the Hebrew <hi>Sheol,</hi> and the Greek <hi>Hades,</hi> is ≈øo large as to comprehend even heaven it ≈øelf in the notion of it: Not indeed as heaven is the place of bli≈ø≈øe and happine≈ø≈øe, nor as it ≈øhall be after the Re≈øurrection, when the ≈øoul and body ≈øhall be in heaven, but as heaven is the receptacle of ≈øouls ≈øeparated from their bodies; which ≈øtate of ≈øeparation (though it rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Some may yet again object, That the word <hi>de≈øcended,</hi> which is u≈øed in the Creed, argues that <hi>hell</hi> is below, whereas heaven is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: and how then can it be ≈øaid, that Chri≈øt (in re≈øpect of his ≈øoul) de≈øcended into hell, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his ≈øoul went to heaven?</p>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:111827:122"/> 
               <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> have carefully recorded Chri≈øts ri≈øing from the dead.

And that afterward Chri≈øt appeared unto them again, <hi>Thomas</hi> being with them, and that he ≈øpake unto <hi>Thomas</hi> ≈øaying, <hi>Reach hither thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thru≈øt it into my ≈øide, and be not faithle≈ø≈øe, but believe:</hi> And that then <hi>Thomas</hi> cried out, <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> Joh. 20. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli≈øts al≈øo record that Chri≈øts re≈øurrection was witne≈ø≈øed by an Angel from heaven, <hi>Mat. 28. 5, 6. Mar.</hi> 16. 5, 6. Yea by more Angels then one, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:111827:122"/>4. The Apo≈øtles did no le≈ø≈øe diligently preach and publi≈øh Chri≈øts re≈øurrection. <hi>Paul</hi> preached it, as he te≈øtifieth, 1 Cor. 15. 4. Where al≈øo in the ver≈øes following he doth largely in≈øi≈øt upon the proof and demon≈øtration of it. So <hi>Act</hi> 13. 30. &amp;c. We find that in one of his Sermons he was much upon this point. And ≈øo al≈øo was <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2. 24. &amp;c. And it is ≈øaid of all the Apo≈øtles in generall (except <hi>Paul</hi> who was called to the Apo≈øtle≈øhip afterward) <hi>that with great power they gave wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the re≈øurrection of the Lord Je≈øus,</hi> Act. 4. 33. And <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth the force of this argument drawn from the preaching of the Apo≈øtles, <hi>Yea, and we are found fal≈øe witne≈ø≈øes of God, becau≈øe we have testified of God, that he rai≈øed up Chri≈øt, whom he rai≈øed not up, if ≈øo be that the dead ri≈øe not,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Divers rea≈øons and arguments grounded upon Scripture prove that Chri≈øt did ri≈øe from the dead. For 1. It was meet that as Chri≈øt did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and voluntarily humble him≈øelf, ≈øo again he ≈øhould be exalted, <hi>Tho≈øe that honour me, I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> ≈øaith God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. Therefore as Chri≈øt did honour God by ≈øubmitting him≈øelf unto death, ≈øo God would honour him by rai≈øing him from the dead. <hi>He humbled him≈øelf, &amp; became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto death, even the death of the Cro≈ø≈øe, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God al≈øo hath highly exalted him,</hi> Phil. 2. 8. 9.<note place="margin">Man≈øit &amp; in ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione in≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parabilis unitas.

            </p>
            <p>2. Although when Chri≈øt died, his ≈øoul and body were ≈øeparated one from the other, yet the divine nature was ≈øeparated from neither the one nor the other. <hi>Come, ≈øee the place where the Lord lay,</hi> ≈øaid the Angel, ≈øpeaking of the grave where
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:111827:123"/> the dead body of Chri≈øt was laid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 6. which ≈øhews that the divine nature was ≈øtill united to the body, though the ≈øoul were ≈øeparated from it. And otherwi≈øe we could not rightly confe≈ø≈øe (as we do) in the Creed, that Chri≈øt the only ≈øon of God was buried. Now there being this union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the divine nature, and Chri≈øts body, it was not only meet, but nece≈ø≈øary that his body ≈øhould be rai≈øed up, and not be held under deaths domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Though being man he died, yet being God he ro≈øe again; <hi>being put to death in the fle≈øh,</hi> (his humane nature) <hi>but quickned by the ≈øpirit,</hi> his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>3. For the working out of our redemption it was requi≈øite that Chri≈øt ≈øhould not only die, but al≈øo ri≈øe again. Some when Chri≈øt did hang upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, bla≈øphemed, ≈øaying, <hi>He ≈øaved others, him≈øelfe he cannot ≈øave,</hi> Mar. 15. 31. Whereas that he might ≈øave others, him≈øelf he would not ≈øave, <hi>viz.</hi> not ≈øo as not to die. But had he ≈øo died, as not to ri≈øe again, his death would have been of none effect. For how could we have believed, that he by his death had redeemed us from death (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eternall death and de≈øtruction) if he him≈øelf had been ≈øo ≈øwallowed up of death, as for ever to lie under the power and dominion of it? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith that Chri≈øt <hi>was delivered for our offences, and ro≈øe again for our justification,</hi> Rom. 4. 25. And, <hi>if Chri≈øt be not ri≈øen, your faith is in vain, you are yet in your ≈øins,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 17. And as Chri≈øts re≈øurrection was thus nece≈ø≈øary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of our <hi>redemption, the forgivene≈ø≈øe of our ≈øins;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe≈ø. 1. 7. Rom. 8. 23.</note> ≈øo was it al≈øo in re≈øpect of the <hi>redemption of our
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:111827:123"/> body.</hi> How could we have expected the re≈øurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our bodies, if Chri≈øts body had not been rai≈øed up? If the Head had not ri≈øen again, how ≈øhould the members ri≈øe again? The re≈øurrection of the members depends upon the re≈øurrection of the Head; the re≈øurrection of Chri≈øtians upon Chri≈øts re≈øurrection, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øhews at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V≈øe.</hi> 1. Now if Chri≈øt ro≈øe again; then how wretched and mi≈øerable are the Jews, who wil not believe Chri≈øts re≈øurrection, but as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, ≈øo do they ≈øtill, impugne and oppo≈øe it. S. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates that when the ≈øouldiers that were ≈øet to guard Chri≈øts ≈øepulcher, went and told the chief Prie≈øts what had happened they gave them large money that they might ≈øay, that whiles they ≈ølept, Chri≈øts Di≈øciples came and ≈øtole them away, <hi>And this ≈øaying,</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>is commonly reported among the Iews untill this day,</hi> Mat. 28. 11. 15. Now con≈øider a little what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd and fooli≈øh fable this was, which yet the Jews were ≈øo ready to believe. 1. How improbable that a few weak timorous men, who but a few daies before did for≈øake, yea one of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwear Chri≈øt, yet now ≈øhould be ≈øo valiant, or rather fool-hardy, as to adventure to ≈øteal Chri≈øt out of the grave, knowing that a guard of ≈øouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was purpo≈øely ≈øet to prevent ≈øuch a de≈øigne? 2. Suppo≈øe they ≈øhould have ≈øo far adventured, as ≈øome of them to e≈øpie whether the ≈øouldiers were a≈øleep or no, yet how could they a≈ø≈øure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, that the ≈øouldiers ≈øhould continue a≈øleep,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:111827:124"/> untill they had di≈øpatched that for which they came? Yea, how could this be, there being a great ≈øtone for them to roll away from the mouth of the ≈øepulcher, which could not be done without making ≈øuch a noi≈øe as to awaken ≈øome of the ≈øouldiers at lea≈øt, if they were a≈øleep before? 3. Grant the Di≈øciples ≈øhould have had ≈øuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as to attempt the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and ≈øuch happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe as to effect it, yet would they have been ≈øo fooli≈øh and unwi≈øe, as to ≈øtay at the ≈øepulcher to unloo≈øe the cloaths in which Chri≈øts body was wrapped? Would they not rather have ha≈øted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the body as it was buried, and have loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the cloths then when they had more lei≈øure to do it, and might do it with more ≈øafety? But the linnen cloths were found lying in the grave, and the napkin that was about Chri≈øts head, not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the linnen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by it ≈øelf, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 6. 7. And 4. if the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples could break thorough all difficulties, and get Chri≈øts body away with them, yet could they put life into it when they had it? But Chri≈øt <hi>after his pa≈ø≈øion, by many infallible proofs ≈øhewed him≈øelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,</hi> Act. 1. 3. otherwi≈øe it is ≈øen≈øle≈ø≈øe to imagine, that the Di≈øciples (having ≈øo de≈øerted Chri≈øt, when he was alive) would have ≈øo con≈øtantly preached and avouched his re≈øurrection, as they did. And la≈øtly, the very tale doth ≈øufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it ≈øelf, and ≈øhew its own ab≈øurdity. For if the ≈øouldiers (as they ≈øaid) were a≈øleep, how then could they tell that Chri≈øt was taken away by his Di≈øciples? it might be otherwi≈øe (as indeed it
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:111827:124"/> was) for any thing thar they did know.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V≈øe</hi> 2. Secondly, Chri≈øts re≈øurrection ≈øerves to demon≈øtrate Chri≈øts divinity. The divinity of Chri≈øt and his re≈øurrection, ≈øo mutually help to demon≈øtrate each other. His re≈øurrection is demon≈øtrated by his divinity, as the effect by the cau≈øe: and his divinity by his refurrection, as the cau≈øe by the effect. That which God the Father ≈øpeaks unto Chri≈øt, P≈øal. 2. 7. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> the Apo≈øtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to Chri≈øts re≈øurrection, Act. 13. 32. 33. <hi>And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled the ≈øame unto us, in that he hath rai≈øed up Ie≈øus again, as it is al≈øo written in the ≈øecond P≈øalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> The Apo≈øtle by this day, ≈øhews that the day of Chri≈øts re≈øurrection is under≈øtood; not that then Chri≈øt was fir≈øt begotten of the Father, and became the Son of God (for he was ≈øo from all eternity<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
               <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 2.) but then when Chri≈øt ro≈øe again he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be the Son of God, his begotten Son, God of God, one and the ≈øame God with the Pather. Thus the ≈øame Apo≈øtle ≈øaith plainly, that Chri≈øt <hi>was declared to be the Son of God, with power, according to the ≈øpirit of holine≈ø≈øe, by the re≈øurrection from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. Chri≈øts divine nature before did lie hid under the infirmity of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, but by his ri≈øing from the dead it did look forth, and ≈øhew it ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some may ≈øay, many others (as we find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded both in the old, and in the new Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:111827:125"/> did ri≈øe from the dead be≈øides Chri≈øt, yea many before Chri≈øt, and how then doth his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection demon≈øtrate his divine nature?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I an≈øwer, Chri≈øts re≈øurrection did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the refunction of others in a twofold re≈øpect. For 1.

            <p>2. Chri≈øt aro≈øe by his own vertue and power, which none ever did, or ≈øhall do, but he only. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy this Temple</hi> (≈øaid Chri≈øt, meaning his body) <hi>and in three daies I will rai≈øe it up,</hi> Joh. 2. 19. <hi>I lay down my life</hi> (≈øaid he) <hi>that I may take it up again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ≈øelf; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again,</hi> Joh. 10. 17. 18.

            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> This doth not follow; Chri≈øt both was rai≈øed of God, and al≈øo did rai≈øe him≈øelf. As man, ≈øo God did rai≈øe him up; as God; ≈øo he ro≈øe of him≈øelf; Chri≈øt and the Father are one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 30. That which the Father doth, he doth al≈øo,

            <p n="1">1. Heavenly mindedne≈ø≈øe. <hi>If ye be ri≈øen with Chri≈øt, ≈øeek tho≈øe things that are above, where Chri≈øt ≈øitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the earth,</hi> Col. 3. 1. 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Love of Gods children. <hi>We know that we are pa≈ø≈øed from death to life, becau≈øe we love the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. This is meant of loving the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> in that very re≈øpect as they are godly, not for by ends, or carnall re≈øpects, which they may do who are not godly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ≈øen≈øe and feeling of ≈øpirituall wants and infirmities. VVhere there is ≈øuch a feeling there is life, as there was in <hi>Paul,</hi> who complained of the corruptions that were in him, as grievous and burthen≈øome unto him; <hi>For I know</hi> (≈øaid he) <hi>that in me (that is in my fle≈øh) no good dwelleth. For to will is pre≈øent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not. For the good that I would do, I do not, but the evill that I would not, that I do. I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is pre≈øent with me. For I delight in the law of God, after the inward man; But I ≈øee another law in my members warring again≈øt the law of my mind, and leading me captive to the law of ≈øin, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who ≈øhall deliver me from the body of this death,</hi> Rom. 7. 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:111827:128"/> On the other ≈øide, ≈øuch appears to be <hi>alienated from the life of God,</hi> as are <hi>without feeling,</hi> Eph. 4. 18, 19. ≈øuch as are full of ≈øin and of corruption, and yet are nothing ≈øen≈øible of it, but like the Angell of the Church of Laodicea, think that they are rich and increa≈øed with goods, and have need of nothing, when as indeed they are wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mi≈øerable, and poor, and blind, and naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

               </hi> Pet. 2. 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Communion with God by prayer. The Spirit which is the worker of this ≈øpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection, is the <hi>Spirit of grace and ≈øupplications,</hi> Zach. 12. 10. <hi>The Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. <hi>Behold he prayeth,</hi> ≈øaid Chri≈øt to <hi>Ananias,</hi> ≈øpeaking of <hi>Saul</hi> (after called <hi>Paul</hi>) when a ≈øpirituall life was newly put into him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11.</p>
            <p>The ordinary means whereby this ≈øpirituall re≈øurrection is wrought, is the Word preached: As at the la≈øt day, <hi>the Trumpet ≈øhall ≈øound, and the dead</hi> (corporally) <hi>≈øhall be rai≈øed,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 52. So they that are ≈øpiritually dead, are rai≈øed by the Trumpet of Gods Word, ≈øounding in their ears: <hi>Verily, verily, I ≈øay unto you,</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt) <hi>that the houre is coming, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w is, that the dead
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:111827:128"/> ≈øhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ≈øhall live,</hi> Joh. 5. 25. That is ≈øpoken of the ≈øpirituall Re≈øurrection, as appears by the≈øe words, <hi>and now is,</hi> even as that which pre≈øently after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, v. 28. &amp; 29. is ≈øpoken of the corporall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection; <hi>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves ≈øhall hear his voice, and ≈øhall come forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the corporall Re≈øurrection and the ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall in this do differ, that the corporall Re≈øurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is compleat and perfect at once; <hi>In a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinkling of an eye,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 52. But the ≈øpirituall re≈øurrection is carried on by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by little and little, <hi>the inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 16. Therefore they that are already in ≈øome mea≈øure made partakers of ≈øpirituall re≈øurrection, mu≈øt ≈øtill labour that they may be made more and more partakers of it; <hi>Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. So much for this point concerning Chri≈øts Re≈øurrection, <hi>That Christ did ri≈øe again from the dead.</hi> I come now to ≈øpeak a little of the time of his Re≈øurrection, <hi>the third day,</hi> and here this point is to be con≈øidered, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> That Chri≈øt did ri≈øe again the third day. So we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe in the Creed, &amp; the Scripture is clear &amp; expre≈øs for it: Chri≈øt fore-telling his re≈øurrection, did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe fore-tell this circum≈øtance of time when it ≈øhould be; <hi>De≈øtroy this Temple, and after three dayes I will rai≈øe it up,</hi> Joh. 2. 19. <hi>From that time farth began Je≈øus to ≈øhew unto his Di≈øciples, how that he mu≈øt go unto Jeru≈øalem, and ≈øuffer many things of the Elders, and chief Prie≈øts and Scribes, and be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:111827:129"/> killed, and be rai≈øed again the third day,</hi> Mat. 16. 21. So Mat. 20. 18, 19. <hi>Behold, we go up to Jeru≈øalem, and the Son of Man ≈øhall be betrayed unto the chief Prie≈øts, and unto the Scribes, and they ≈øhall condemn him to death; And ≈øhall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to ≈øcourge, and crucifie him, and the third day he ≈øhall ri≈øe again:</hi> And ≈øo much the chief Prie≈øts and Phari≈øees had under≈øtood, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their words to <hi>Pilate, Sir, we remember that that deceiver ≈øaid, while he was yet alive, after three dayes I will ri≈øe again.</hi> And therefore they de≈øired to have Chri≈øts Sepulchre watched but <hi>till the third day,</hi> Mat. 27. 63, 64.</p>
            <p>All the four Evangeli≈øts al≈øo do record, as that Chri≈øt ro≈øe again, ≈øo that he ro≈øe again the third day.</p>
            <p>So al≈øo <hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>how that Chri≈øt did for our ≈øins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he ro≈øe again the third day,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>It was congruous and meet that Chri≈øt ≈øhould ri≈øe again the third day, not ≈øooner nor later. Not ≈øooner, to ≈øhew that he was truly dead, and for a while under the power of death, and the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which is meant by his being in hell, as was ≈øhevved before. Not later, that ≈øo he might comfort and revive the drooping and dying ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Di≈øciples, who after his death, untill they heard of his re≈øurrection <hi>mourned and wept,</hi> Mar. 16. 10. And that he might ≈øtrengthen their faith which was ready to fail, as appears by that Luk. 24. 21. <hi>We tru≈øted that it had been he, that ≈øhould have redeemed</hi> I≈ørael.</p>
            <pb n="249" facs="tcp:111827:129"/>
            <p>Again, it was not only congruous and meet, but al≈øo requi≈øite and nece≈ø≈øary that Chri≈øt ≈øhould ri≈øe the third day, becau≈øe ≈øo it was 1. prefigured; viz. by that which happened unto <hi>Ionas;</hi> his being three daies and three nights in the fi≈øhes belly, neither more nor le≈ø≈øe, ≈øignified that Chri≈øt ≈øhould be ≈øo long, neither more nor le≈ø≈øe in the grave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 40.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If Chri≈øt were three daies and three nights in the grave, how then did he ri≈øe again the third day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Tho≈øe three daies, and three nights are taken ≈øynecdochically, that is, not for three whole daies, and three whole nights, but for part of three daies, and part of three nights. Chri≈øt died and was buried (as the Evangeli≈øts ≈øhew) the day before the Jewi≈øh Sabbath, that is on Friday (as we call it) towards evening; that part of the day is [by a ≈øynedoche] reckoned for a day, and to it belongs the night going before, the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the naturall day, which con≈øi≈øts of 24. hours, at evening, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 32. Then Chri≈øt lay in the grave the night following, and the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which we call Saturday, here are two daies and two nights, and ≈øo likewi≈øe he remained in the grave the night after, and ro≈øe early in the morning, to which night mu≈øt be added the day following, which we call Sunday, as being a part of that naturall day to which it belonged; and ≈øo there are three daies and three nights, and yet Chri≈øt ro≈øe the third day.

And by this S. <hi>Paul</hi> proves that the words were not meant of <hi>David</hi> him≈øelf, but of Chri≈øt; for that <hi>David</hi> ≈øaw corruption, but Chri≈øt (being rai≈øed from the dead the third day) ≈øaw no corruption, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 35, 36, 37.

            </p>
            <p>Divers of the Evangeli≈øts do al≈øo record Chri≈øts a≈øcen≈øion: <hi>He was received up into heaven,</hi> Mar. 16. 19. <hi>He was parted from them, (viz.</hi> his Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,) <hi>and was carried up into heaven,</hi> Luk. 24. 51. <hi>While they beheld he was taken up,</hi> Acts 1. 9.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Luke</hi> al≈øo relates the circum≈øtances of Chri≈øts a≈øcen≈øion: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The time when he a≈øcended, <hi>viz.</hi> forty daies
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:111827:133"/> after his re≈øurrection: <hi>To whom al≈øo he ≈øhewed him≈øelf alive after his pa≈ø≈øion by many infallible proofs, being ≈øeen of them forty dayes, and ≈øpeaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 1. 3. where he giveth two rea≈øons why Chri≈øt did continue ≈øo long upon earth after his re≈øurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before he a≈øcended into heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. To confirme unto his Di≈øciples his re≈øurrection, and to a≈ø≈øure them of the truth of it. 2. To in≈øtruct them in things pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The place where, viz. Bethany: <hi>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 24. 50. Now Joh. 11. 1. it's ≈øaid that Bethany was the Town of <hi>Mary</hi> and her ≈øi≈øter <hi>Martha,</hi> that is, the towne where they dwelt, and had their abode; in which ≈øen≈øe Beth≈øaida is called the City of <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 1. 44. Yet it ≈øeems that the place where Chri≈øt a≈øcended, was not the town called Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but the Tract of Mount Olivet, where the Town ≈øtood. For it is ≈øaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 12. That the Di≈øciples who were with Chri≈øt at his a≈øcen≈øion, immediately after he was a≈øcended, <hi>returned unto Ieru≈øalem from the Mount called Olivet.</hi> It is not likely that Chri≈øt would be in a Town, when he a≈øcended; for then all promi≈øcuou≈øly would have ≈øeen his a≈øcen≈øion, whereas only his Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were Spectators of it: Neither is it ≈øaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 50. that Chri≈øt led them to Bethanie, and there a≈øcended, but that <hi>he led them out [viz.</hi> from Jeru≈øalem] <hi>as farre as Bethanie. S. Luke</hi> ch. 19. v. 29. tells us, that as Chri≈øt went to his Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, he went by Bethanie; ≈øo that by the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:111827:133"/> ≈øame place by which he went to his Pa≈ø≈øion, he had his a≈øcen≈øion.</p>
            <p>And Bethany al≈øo ≈øignifies as much as the <hi>hou≈øe of affliction;</hi> if we will a≈øcend up to our Fathers hou≈øe to heaven, it mu≈øt be by Bethany, the hou≈øe of affliction: <hi>We mu≈øt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 14. 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The manner how he a≈øcended; <hi>And it came to pa≈ø≈øe while he ble≈ø≈øed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven,</hi> Luke 24. 51. <hi>Thus having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them to the end,</hi> Joh. 13. 1. At the very la≈øt moment of his abiding here upon earth, he ble≈ø≈øed tho≈øe that were with him, and in them us, and all that belong unto him: As he ≈øaid <hi>Ioh. 17. 20. Neither pray I for the≈øe alone, but for them al≈øo which ≈øhall believe on me through their word;</hi> So neither did he ble≈ø≈øe them alone, but them al≈øo which through their word believe in him. Again, for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chri≈øts a≈øcen≈øion, it is ≈øaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9. That <hi>while they</hi> (his Di≈øciples) <hi>beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ≈øight,</hi> So that Chri≈øt did a≈øcend vi≈øibly, and there were eye-witne≈ø≈øes of his a≈øcen≈øion: and le≈øt they ≈øhould have imagined, that their ≈øen≈øes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, or any way have doubted of the truth of Chri≈øts a≈øcen≈øion, two Angels from heaven in the likene≈ø≈øe of men appeared unto them, both to confirm Chri≈øts a≈øcen≈øion into heaven, and al≈øo to ≈øhew that he was not ≈øo a≈øcended, but that he ≈øhall at length come againe, <hi>viz.</hi> at the la≈øt judgement. <hi>And while they looked ≈øtedfa≈øtly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heaven, as he went up, behold two men ≈øtood
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:111827:134"/> by them in white apparell, which al≈øo ≈øaid, ye men of Galilee, why ≈øtand ye gazing up into heaven? This ≈øame Je≈øus, which is taken up from you into heaven, ≈øhall ≈øo come in like manner, as ye have ≈øeen him go into heaven,</hi> Act. 1. 10. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some may here object that Joh. 3. 13. <hi>The Son of man, which is in heaven.</hi> If Chri≈øt then being upon earth, were in heaven, how could he a≈øcend into heaven?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Yes, being in heaven (even when he was upon earth) as God, he might neverthele≈ø≈øe, and did as man a≈øcend into heaven. Chri≈øt con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting of two natures, the divine, and the humane, ≈øomething belongs unto him in re≈øpect of the one nature, and ≈øomething in re≈øpect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In re≈øpect of his divine nature he is every where, in re≈øpect of his humane, he is onely in one place at one time. The man Chri≈øt, yet not as man, but as God, was in heaven at the ≈øame time that he was upon earth. On the other ≈øide, Chri≈øt being God, yet not as God, but as man, left the earth, and went up to heaven.</p>
            <p>There are many rea≈øons why Chri≈øt a≈øcended into heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As he came from heaven to work our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ≈øo having fini≈øhed the work which he<note place="margin">Rea≈øons of Chri≈øts A≈øcen≈øion</note> had to do, it was meet that he ≈øhould return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from whence he came; <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world, and go to the Father,</hi> ≈øaid he, Joh. 16. 28. And Joh. 17. 4, 5. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have fini≈øhed the work which thou gave≈øt me to do, and now, O Father, glorifie me with thine
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:111827:134"/> own ≈øelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. After Chri≈øts humiliation, was to follow his exaltation, as Chri≈øt him≈øelf ≈øhewed, Luk. 24. 26. And ≈øo <hi>Paul</hi> Phil. 2. 8, 9. Now as Chri≈øts Re≈øurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was the fir≈øt ≈øtep of his exaltation, ≈øo his A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen≈øion was another ≈øtep, and a further degree of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus Chri≈øt made it appear, that (as he told <hi>Pilate</hi>) his Kingdom is not of this world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 36. Contrary to what his own Di≈øciples did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, even after his re≈øurrection, as appears by that que≈øtion which they asked him, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the Kingdom to I≈ørael?</hi> Act. 1. 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Chri≈øt by his a≈øcen≈øion ≈øhewed him≈øelf to have fully conquered ≈øin, death and Satan; he did manife≈øt his victory over the≈øe by his Re≈øurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but more fully by his a≈øcen≈øion, whereby he did triumph over them: Therefore it is ≈øaid, that when <hi>he a≈øcended up on high, he led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4. 8. that is, he led a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of captives, as the phra≈øe is u≈øed, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It was requi≈øite that Chri≈øt ≈øhould a≈øcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, that as he executed the office of a Prie≈øt, by offering him≈øelf upon the Cro≈ø≈øe for us, ≈øo he might al≈øo do it by appearing before God in heaven, and there making interce≈ø≈øion unto him for us. <hi>Aaron</hi> the Jewi≈øh high Prie≈øt was to bear the names of the children of I≈ørael in the bre≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of judgement upon his heart, when he went into the holy place for a memoriall before the

            <p>Chri≈øt was to a≈øcend into heaven, that ≈øo he might powre his ≈øpirit upon his Church: <hi>When he a≈øcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4. 8. <hi>viz.</hi> ≈øpirituall gifts, the gifts and graces of his ≈øpirit, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 68. 18. it is ≈øaid that at his a≈øcen≈øion he <hi>received gifts,</hi> but <hi>for men,</hi> and that is as much as to give gifts unto men. <hi>Fetch me a little water,</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Eliah</hi> to the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, 1 Kings 17. 10. according to the originall it is, Receive, or take me (or for me) a little water;<note place="margin">

Though they be too ≈øtrong for us, yet Chri≈øt is too ≈øtrong for them, and much le≈ø≈øe are they able to re≈øi≈øt him, then we are to re≈øi≈øt them.

            <p>CHri≈øts ≈øitting at the right hand of God, is (as I have formerly ≈øhewed) the highe≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his exaltation; and therefore his coming to judge both the quick and the dead, is not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree above it, but belongs unto it as a part of it: Chri≈øts ≈øitting at the right hand of God (as hath been ≈øhewed) denotes that ≈øupreme power and dignity unto which Chri≈øt is exalted above all creatures: Now the mo≈øt clear evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtration of this dignity and power, in the full exerci≈øe of it, ≈øhall be ≈øeen by Chri≈øts coming to Judgement; then ≈øhall every knee be made to

            <p>But neither is this interpretation to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for thus the words <hi>quick and dead,</hi> are taken metaphorically, and not properly, whereas we ought not to recede from the propriety of words, except nece≈ø≈øity enforce thereunto, which here it doth not. 2. That by <hi>quick</hi> vve are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand tho≈øe vvho are novv alive, or ≈øhall be alive at Chri≈øts coming; and by <hi>dead</hi> tho≈øe vvho are novv dead, or ≈øhall be at Chri≈øts coming: and this indeed is the true and genuine meaning of the vvords.

            <p>For the fir≈øt, That all generally ≈øhall be judged, the Scripture is plain and expre≈ø≈øe, <hi>Heb. 9. 27.

            <p>This truth al≈øo may be confirmed by divers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The judgements which God hath already executed, or doth execute upon tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors, prove that there is a judgement to come; <hi>S.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:111827:162"/> every tongue ≈øhall confe≈ø≈øe him to be Lord over all.

            <p>2. That ≈øo the judiciall proceedings might be in an outward and vi≈øible manner. And thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do more fitly expound that, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 27. Where it is ≈øaid that authority to execute judgment is given unto Chri≈øt, becau≈øe he is the ≈øon of man, that is, becau≈øe he only of all the three Per≈øons is man, and con≈øequently is meet ≈øo to execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that he may generally be ≈øeen of all.

And peculiarly holine≈ø≈øe is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the third Per≈øon in the Ble≈ø≈øed Trinity; though the fir≈øt per≈øon and the ≈øecond per≈øon be holy too, yet the third per≈øon is peculiarly ≈øtiled holy, it being the peculiar work of this per≈øon to ≈øanctifie and make holy. Not as if the Father and the Son did not ≈øanctifie as well as the Holy Gho≈øt, but the Father and the Son do ≈øanctifie by the Holy Gho≈øt; whence ≈øanctification is called <hi>the ≈øanctification of the ≈øpirit,</hi> 2 The≈ø. 2. 13. becau≈øe it is peculiarly wrought by the ≈øpirit, and ≈øo much for the name Holy Gho≈øt, or holy Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The nature of the holy Gho≈øt is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, <hi>viz.</hi> that the holy Gho≈øt is God truly and<note place="margin">Of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Holy Gho≈øt that the Holy Gho≈øt is God.</note> properly ≈øo called, having one and the ≈øame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature with the Father and the Son, for <hi>the≈øe three are one,</hi> 1. Ioh. 5. 7. three per≈øons, yet but one God, as hath been ≈øhewed before upon that Text; but here the Godhead of the Holy Gho≈øt is to be proved more fully: and we have clear te≈øtimony of Scripture for it: <hi>VVhy hath Satan filled thine
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:111827:168"/> heart, to lie unto the Holy Ghost?</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias,</hi> Act. 5. 3. And he adds pre≈øently after, <hi>Thou ha≈øt not lied unto men, but unto God,</hi> v. 4. This clearly ≈øhews the Holy Gho≈øt to be God. And the ≈øame may further be confirmed by divers arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Divine attributes belong unto the holy Gho≈øt, ≈øuch as are proper unto God, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Holy Gho≈øt is God. Ubiquity, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øence, to be every where, which is peculiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, is attributed to the Holy Gho≈øt. <hi>Whither ≈øhall I go from thy ≈øpirit?</hi> P≈øal. 139. 7. So al≈øo is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øcience, to know all things, which likewi≈øe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to God only: <hi>The ≈øpirit ≈øearcheth all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Divine works are a≈øcribed to the Holy Gho≈øt, ≈øuch works as none can do but only God, and therefore al≈øo the Holy Gho≈øt is God. The work of Creation, which is proper unto God, belongs to the Holy Gho≈øt. <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me,</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 33. 4. And ≈øurely he that made him, made all. So al≈øo the work of ≈øanctification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only unto God; <hi>The very God of peace ≈øancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you wholly,</hi> 1 The≈ø. 5. 23. Yet this work is a≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Holy Gho≈øt; yea this Per≈øon (as hath been ≈øhewed) is therefore called the Holy Gho≈øt, becau≈øe he peculiarly doth work ≈øanctification, and make holy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Divine honour is given to the Holy Gho≈øt, that honor which is due only unto God: And this al≈øo evinceth that the Holy Gho≈øt is God: <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho≈øt,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. We may not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, or be baptized in the name of any, but only
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:111827:168"/> of God. <hi>Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul?</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 13. Seeing therefore that we bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize and are baptized, according to Chri≈øts own in≈øtitution, as in the name of the Father, and of the Son<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> ≈øo al≈øo of the holy Gho≈øt, it nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows that as the Father is God, and the Son God, ≈øo is the Holy Gho≈øt God al≈øo. And ≈øo in the Text, that we have in hand, the Apo≈øtle prayeth for the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, as the grace of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt (the Son) and the love of God (the Father) ≈øo likewi≈øe the communion of the Holy Gho≈øt; and it is an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit invocation as of Chri≈øt the Son, and of God the Father, ≈øo of the holy Gho≈øt; as if the Apo≈øtle ≈øhould have ≈øaid, I pray to our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that his grace, and to God (the Father) that his love, and to the Holy Gho≈øt, that his communion may be with you all: and this may ≈øuffice to prove that the holy Gho≈øt is God.</p>
            <p>3. I pa≈ø≈øe to the per≈øon of the holy Gho≈øt; and<note place="margin">Of the per≈øon of the Holy Gho≈øt.</note> here three things are to be con≈øidered. 1. That the Holy Gho≈øt is a Per≈øon. 2. That the Holy Gho≈øt is a per≈øon di≈øtinct from the Father and the Son. 3. That the Holy Gho≈øt is a per≈øon proceeding both from the Father, and from the Son.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The holy Gho≈øt is a per≈øon, not an attribute<note place="margin">That the H. Gho≈øt is a per≈øon.</note> or affection, as mercy, ju≈øtice, power, wi≈ødom, and the like. For tho≈øe things which are proper and peculiar to a per≈øon are attributed to the holy Gho≈øt, as to be vexed &amp; grieved, <hi>They vexed his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øpirit,</hi> I≈øai. 63. 10. <hi>Grieve not the holy ≈øpirit of God,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4. 30. True it is, the holy Gho≈øt being God, cannot properly be vexed or grieved, but this (as
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:111827:169"/> other things in Scripture) is ≈øpoken after the manner of men, but however it argueth that the holy Gho≈øt is a per≈øon, even as that P≈øal. 95. 10. <hi>Fourty years long was I grieved with this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ≈øhews him that ≈øpake it, to be a per≈øon. So when the holy Gho≈øt is ≈øaid to ≈øpeak, to command and injoyn, it argues that the Holy Gho≈øt is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. <hi>The Holy Gho≈øt ≈øaid, Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, &amp;c. Act. 13. 2. Above all, that <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16. is mo≈øt ≈øtrong and forcible for this purpo≈øe. There it is ≈øaid, that the Holy Gho≈øt came down in the likene≈ø≈øe of a dove, which could not be except the Holy Gho≈øt were a per≈øon: For nothing but a per≈øon can a≈ø≈øume a ≈øhape wherein to appeare; a meer attribute or affection cannot do it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Holy Gho≈øt is a per≈øon di≈øtinct from the<note place="margin">That the H. Gho≈øt is a per≈øon di≈øtinct from the Father and the Son.</note> Father and the Son. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ≈øhall give you another Comforter,</hi> ≈øaid Chri≈øt to his Di≈øciples, Joh. 14. 16. The Comforter there ≈øpoken of is the Holy Gho≈øt, as appears v. 17. <hi>Even the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth,</hi> &amp;c. and v. 26. <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy Gho≈øt.</hi> This therefore is another, a per≈øon di≈øtinct from Chri≈øt the Son, and ≈øo likewi≈øe from the Father. For the Father doth ≈øend this Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Holy Gho≈øt, Iohn 14. 26. Now the per≈øon ≈øending, and the per≈øon ≈øent mu≈øt needs be di≈øtinct the one from the other. And this ≈øame rea≈øon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo proveth the Son and the Holy Gho≈øt to be two di≈øtinct per≈øons, becau≈øe the Holy Gho≈øt is ≈øent by the Son; <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I will ≈øend unto you,</hi> ≈øaid Chri≈øt, Joh. 15. 26. And ≈øo Ioh. 16. 7. <hi>If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will ≈øend him unto
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:111827:169"/> you.</hi> The di≈øtinction al≈øo of the Holy Gho≈øt both from the Father, and from the Son, is evident by that Mat. 28. 19. <hi>Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son; and of the Holy Gho≈øt.</hi> As likewi≈øe by this conclu≈øion, whereof the Text is a part, <hi>The grace of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and the love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Gho≈øt be with you all.</hi> The≈øe places do clearly ≈øhew that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho≈øt are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinct per≈øons: and ≈øo <hi>S.

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4. In the fourth and la≈øt place we are to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Holy Gho≈øt.</note> the operation of the Holy Gho≈øt. In re≈øpect of operation it is that the Holy Gho≈øt is ≈øaid to be ≈øent, or given, <hi>Gal. 4. 6. Rom.</hi> 5. 5. For the Holy Gho≈øt is not ≈øo ≈øent, or given, as to be where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not, but only ≈øo as to operate other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe then he did. The operation of the ≈øpirit is called, <hi>the manife≈øtation of the ≈øpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 7. becau≈øe by the operation of the ≈øpirit, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of the ≈øpirit is made manife≈øt, the operation it ≈øelf being ≈øuch as is manife≈øt.</p>
            <pb n="331" facs="tcp:111827:170"/>
            <p>Now the operation of the ≈øpirit is either ≈øuch as is common to the Elect and reprobate, or ≈øuch as is proper and peculiar to the Elect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as is common to the Elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: and that is of divers ≈øorts. 1. That whereby one is fitted for his particular calling, whether it be ≈øacred or civill. It is Iudg. 11. 29. <hi>that the ≈øpirit of the Lord came upon</hi> Iephthah. And 1 Sam. 11. 6. <hi>that the Spirit of the Lord came upon</hi> Saul. So Exod. 31. 3. that Bezaleel <hi>was filled with the ≈øpirit of God.</hi> The meaning is, that <hi>Iephthah</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Spirit were indued with courage and valour, and <hi>Bezaleel</hi> with wi≈ødome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding, whereby both they and he were made meet for that office, and imployment to which they were called. In the primitive times of the Go≈øpel, there were extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho≈øt, as ability to ≈øpeak ≈øtrange tongues, to work ≈øtrange cures, and to do many miracles; and the≈øe gifts were common to the reprobate, as appears by that, Mat. 7. 22, 23. <hi>Many will ≈øay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophecied in thy name, and in thy name ca≈øt out devills, and in thy name done many wonderfull works? And then will I profe≈ø≈øe unto them, I never knew you, Depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi> And when Chri≈øt ≈øent the Apo≈øtles, giving them power to heal the ≈øick, to clean≈øe the lepers, to rai≈øe the dead, and to ca≈øt out devils, he ≈øent <hi>Iudas</hi> among them, and gave him power in this kind as well as the re≈øt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1. &amp;c. And in re≈øpect of tho≈øe extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho≈øt, mo≈øt probably it was, that ≈øome being asked if they had received the Holy

It is hardly to be imagined, that they who ≈øpake this, having been partakers (as they ≈øaid them≈øelves) of <hi>Johns</hi> Bapti≈øme, could be ignorant whether there were ≈øuch a divine Per≈øon which is called the Holy Gho≈øt; but they might be ignorant whether there were ≈øuch miraculous gifts of the Holy Gho≈øt given unto believers: It followes there v. 6. that <hi>when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they ≈øpake with tongues, and prophecied.</hi> The Holy Gho≈øt did then manife≈øt him≈øelf in them by extraordinary gifts which he did confer on them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some mea≈øure of illumination: This al≈øo is a common work of the Spirit; the reprobate are illuminated in ≈øome mea≈øure by the Holy Gho≈øt, as well as the elect.

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:111827:171"/>3. Some ≈øtirring of the affections: this is likewi≈øe an operation of the Holy Gho≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the wicked with the godly: thus the Holy Gho≈øt did operate in Agrippa, when he ≈øaid unto <hi>Paul, Almo≈øt thou per≈øwadest me to be a Christian,</hi> Act. 26. 28.

            <p n="4">4. Some re≈øtraining grace, whereby to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from acting the evill which otherwi≈øe one would act; this al≈øo the Holy Gho≈øt doth work, as well in the unregenerate, as in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.

The≈øe operations of the Holy Gho≈øt are common.</p>
            <p>2. There is an operation of the ≈øpirit, which is proper to the Elect. As 1. Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby one is ≈øo changed, as in a ≈øpirituall ≈øen≈øe to be borne again, and to be a new creature. <hi>That which is born of the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is ≈øpirit,</hi> John 3. 6. <hi>Not by works of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, which we have done, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his mercy he ≈øaved us, by the wa≈øhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and the renewing of the Holy Gho≈øt,</hi> (that is, renewing wrought by the Holy Gho≈øt) <hi>which he ≈øhed on us abundantly, thorough Ie≈øus Chri≈øt our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 3. 5, 6.

In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of this operation of the ≈øpirit, ≈øome are <hi>≈øen≈øuall, not having the ≈øpirit,</hi> Jude v. 19.</p>
            <p>2. Direction; whereby to be guided in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary and ≈øaving truth, and to be kept from all de≈øtructive and damnable errour, either in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or practice. <hi>I will put my ≈øpirit wtthin you, and cau≈øe you to walk in my ≈øtatutes,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 36. 27. <hi>When the ≈øpirit of truth is come, he wil guide you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth.</hi> Joh. 16. 13. This promi≈øe might have peculiar reference to the Apo≈øtles, who were gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ≈øpirit after an extraordinary manner; but in re≈øpect of things nece≈ø≈øary unto ≈øalvation, it belongs to all believers, and to them only. <hi>For as many as are led by the ≈øpirit of God, they are the ≈øons of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 13.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> and fellow≈øhip of the Holy Gho≈øt is a thing much<note place="margin">That which in the Text is called <hi>the Communion of the Holy Gho≈øt,</hi> is called, Phil. 2. 1. the <hi>fellow≈øhip of the ≈øpirit.</hi> As the ≈øame word in the Originall, that is rendred in the one place <hi>communion,</hi> in the other <hi>fellow≈øhip.</hi>
               </note> to be de≈øired.</p>
            <p>The Apo≈øtle in the very conclu≈øion of his Epi≈øtle praies for tho≈øe to whom he writes, that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this communion, which argues that it is a thing very precious and de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>The ≈øame may appear by that which we read of <hi>Eli≈øha,</hi> who when <hi>Eliah</hi> being to be taken from him, bad him ask what he ≈øhould do for him, made only this reque≈øt, <hi>I pray thee, let a double portion of thy ≈øpirit be upon me,</hi> 2 Kings 2. 9. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not (as ≈øome are apt to mi≈øtake it) that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øha</hi> de≈øired to have twice as much of the Spirit as <hi>Eliah</hi> had, but the phra≈øe there u≈øed, is the ≈øame with that which is u≈øed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 17. and from thence the true and genuine meaning is to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:111827:174"/> be fetched. There it is ≈øaid, that the fir≈øt born was to have a double portion, word for word, <hi>the mouth of two,</hi> that is, he was to receive twice as much of his Fathers ≈øub≈øtance as any of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; So <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> de≈øired, that he might be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as <hi>Eliahs</hi> fir≈øt borne, and that he might have twice as much of the Spirit which was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as the other Prophets ≈øhould have: Thus is the place to be under≈øtood; but ≈øtill it ≈øhewes what account <hi>Eli≈øha,</hi> who had already ≈øo much of the Spirit, as to know the worth of it, did make of this communion of the Holy Gho≈øt: <hi>David</hi> al≈øo, by whom the Spirit of the Lord did ≈øpeak, as he ≈øaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23 2. when his con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was afflicted for his foule and grievous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities, was very ≈øollicitous in this re≈øpect, le≈øt he ≈øhould not injoy the communion of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gho≈øt, as he had done; <hi>Ca≈øt me not away from thy pre≈øence</hi> (≈øaies he unto God) <hi>and take not thy holy Spirit from me,</hi> P≈øal. 51. 11. And v. 12. <hi>Restore unto me the joy of thy ≈øalvation, and ≈øtabli≈øh me with thy free Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How the communion of the Holy Gho≈øt is to be prized, we may likewi≈øe perceive by tho≈øe exhortations of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Quench not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 The≈ø. 5. 19. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4. 30. <hi>Be filled with the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 5. 18. So al≈øo by that commemoration which the people of God made unto him of his ≈øingular favour ≈øhewed unto their Fathers, <hi>Thou gave≈øt al≈øo thy good Spirit to in≈øtruct them,</hi> Neh. 9. 20.</p>
            <p>For the further confirmation of the point, let us con≈øider,</p>

               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:111827:175"/>1.

            <p n="2">2. The commodity of this communion of the holy Gho≈øt: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Holy Gho≈øt will teach, informe, and in≈øtruct; <hi>Thou gavest thy good ≈øpirit to in≈øtruct them,</hi> Neh. 9. 20.

We are naturally blind and ignorant of the truth, and many errors creep in, and in≈øinuate them≈øelves under the name of truth; but the Holy Gho≈øt is the <hi>≈øpirit of truth,</hi> and will inlighten our minds, and teach us to know and under≈øtand the truth: <hi>Joh. 14. 26. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Gho≈øt, whom the Father will ≈øend in my name, he ≈øhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, what≈øoever I have ≈øaid unto you:</hi> Joh. 14. 26. <hi>Howbeit when the ≈øpirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth,</hi> Joh. 16. 13.

Without the Holy Gho≈øt we can know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>viz.</hi> of the things of God, the things that concern ≈øalvation. <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ≈øave the ≈øpirit of man which is in him? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ≈øo the things of God knoweth no man but the ≈øpirit of God.

This is a ≈øpeciall evidence of the holy Gho≈øt dwelling in us, if we delight in tho≈øe in whom the gifts and graces of the holy Gho≈øt do appear and ≈øhine forth. <hi>David</hi> having much of Gods ≈øpirit in him, and de≈øiring ≈øtill more, calls the Saints <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> and profe≈ø≈øeth that all his delight was in them, P≈øal. 16. 3.

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I an≈øwer: It is true, that <hi>Cepha</hi> is both the ≈øame with <hi>Peter</hi> a proper name, and al≈øo ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a ≈øtone, or a Rock; but the Greek Text ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one word for <hi>Peter</hi> and another for <hi>rocke,</hi> ≈øhewes that by <hi>Cepha the rock</hi> is not meant the ≈øame as by <hi>Cepha Peter,</hi> but ≈øome other thing, <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p>But further, the Church thus taken for ≈øuch a<note place="margin">Of the Church militant, and the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</note> company of per≈øons, is divers wayes di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is the Church militant, and the Church triumphant: The Church militant is that company which is here upon earth in warfare, warring with Satan the world and the fle≈øh. The Church triumphant is that company which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vanqui≈øhed and overcome tho≈øe adver≈øaries, doth reign and triumph in heaven. This di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is grounded upon the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle, <hi>I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, of whom the whole Family in heaven and earth is named,</hi> Eph. 3. 14, 15. And in other places ≈øometimes the Church militant, ≈øometimes the Church triumphant is hinted; <hi>Fight the good fight of faith,</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> being a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:111827:184"/> of the Church militant, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 12. I have fought a good fight,</hi> ≈øaid he, when he was about to pa≈ø≈øe from the Church militant to the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 4. 7. So it is the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant that S. <hi>John</hi> ≈øpeaks of, ≈øaying, <hi>After this I beheld, and loe a great multitude, which no man could number, of all Nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues ≈øtood before the Throne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palmes in their hands,</hi> viz. in token of the victory that they had atchieved, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. But the Church militant is that which u≈øually is ≈øpoken of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>God hath ≈øet ≈øome in the Church, fir≈øt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles, ≈øecondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>Yet in the Church I had rather ≈øpeak five words with mine understanding, that by my voice I might teach others al≈øo, then ten thou≈øand words in an unknown tongue,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 19. And ≈øo in many other places.</p>
            <p>And the Church as here upon earth, con≈øi≈øts partly of ≈øuch as are indeed of it, partly of ≈øuch as onely in ≈øhew and profe≈ø≈øion belong unto it; For <hi>all are not I≈ørael, that are of I≈ørael,</hi> Rom. 9. 6. that is, all are not indeed the people of God, who profe≈ø≈øe them≈øelves to be of that number: No, ≈øome call them≈øelves Jewes, that is, Gods people, yet are not, but are the ≈øynagogue of Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. Onely true believers are indeed of the Church: For, <hi>if any one have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, the ≈øame is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. Prophane per≈øons and hypocrites are rather <hi>in the Church,</hi> then <hi>of the Church,</hi> like woodden leggs that are outwardly joyned to the body, yet are
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:111827:185"/> indeed no parts of the body; <hi>They went out from us but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 19. So ≈øpeaks <hi>S. John</hi> of ≈øome Apo≈øtates and back-≈øliders, ≈øhewing that then when they profe≈ø≈øed them≈øelves to be of the Church, yet indeed they were not of it.</p>

            <p>In the Creed the Church is ≈øtiled <hi>holy,</hi> and ≈øo it is: They that are indeed of the Church, are indeed holy; <hi>Ye are wa≈øhed, ye are ≈øanctified,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>Wherefore holy brethren, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 3. 1.

Ye are carnall; for whereas there are among you envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ≈øtrife, and divi≈øions, are ye not carnall, and walk as men? 1 Cor. 3. 3. Now in this that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you, I prai≈øe you not, that you come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not for the better, but for the wor≈øe. For first of all, when ye come together in the Church, I hear that there be divi≈øions among you, and I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe it: For there mu≈øt al≈øo be here≈øies among you, that they which are approved may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt. When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper; for in eating every one taketh before other his own ≈øupper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken: What have you not hou≈øes to eat and drink in? Or, de≈øpi≈øe ye the Church of God, and ≈øhame them that have not? What ≈øhall I ≈øay unto you? ≈øhall I prai≈øe you in this? I prai≈øe you not,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>How ≈øay ≈øome among you, that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection of the dead?</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 12. <hi>I feare le≈øt when I come I ≈øhall not find you ≈øuch as I would, and that I ≈øhall be found unto you ≈øuch as ye would not, le≈øt there be debates, envyings, wraths, ≈øtrifes, backbitings, whi≈øperings, ≈øwellings, tumults; and le≈øt when I come again, my God will humble me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and that I ≈øhall bewail many which have ≈øinned already, and have not repented of the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and fornication, and la≈øciviou≈øne≈ø≈øe which they have committed,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 20, 21. By the≈øe pa≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we may ≈øee how farre from that purity and holine≈ø≈øe that was requi≈øite, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, and yet the Apo≈øtle ≈øtiled them <hi>the Church of God,</hi>

So it appears by the ≈øecond and third Chapters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> how corrupt and un≈øound the Churches of <hi>A≈øia</hi> there ≈øpoken of, were both in doctrine and manners, yet ≈øtill Chri≈øt accounted them Churches, and only exhorted them to repent and amend, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe threatning to powre his wrath upon them, he never taxed any for abiding in them, ≈øo that they did not joyn in tho≈øe corruptions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Some may object that of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye ≈øeparate,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> But it was not the Apo≈øtles meaning, that Chri≈øtians ≈øhould ≈øeparate from a Church; wherein are found wicked per≈øons, as if it were not lawfull to joyn with ≈øuch in the u≈øe of Gods Ordinances, for then we ≈øhould not know where to find a Church upon earth to joyn our ≈øelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the whole ≈øeries and tenour both of the old and new Te≈øtament is again≈øt ≈øuch ≈øeparation: but the meaning is, that Chri≈øtians mu≈øt ≈øeparate from all wicked ones ≈øo as not to joyn with them in their wickedne≈ø≈øe. So immediately there it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>touch not the unclean</hi> thing, that is, do not joyn with others in their pollutions. So Ephe≈ø. 5. 6, 7. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words, for becau≈øe of the≈øe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of di≈øobedience.

            </p>
            <p>Thus then by Scripture the ca≈øe is clear, that ≈øuch holine≈ø≈øe of Church-members as ≈øome ≈øtand upon, is not e≈ø≈øentiall to the Church, nor any nece≈ø≈øary mark of it. And in this all our famous Prote≈øtant Divines (that I know) agree. I will only cite one, who for his worth and excellency may be in ≈øtead of all, viz. <hi>Calvin. the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>≈øay, that</hi>

               <hi>where≈øoever evill per≈øons are not excluded from communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there a Chri≈øtian doth pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute him≈øelf, if he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. We on the other≈øide ≈øay, that a Christian ought to be grieved, when he ≈øees the Holy Supper polluted by the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that are admitted unto it; and that he ought to indeavor what he can, that it may not be ≈øo polluted. But if it be, yet he may not deprive him≈øelf of the Sacrament, and withdraw him≈øelf from communion, but must rather per≈øi≈øt in this re≈øolution, ≈øo long as he abides there, together with others, to wor≈øhip God, hear the word, and receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi> Much more he hath to this purpo≈øe, alledging many places both of the old and new Te≈øtament for proof of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another note of the Church which ≈øome<note place="margin">2. Church Covenant.</note> much ≈øtand upon, is a Church-Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> an expre≈ø≈øe Covenant, which all the members of the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:111827:196"/> Church mu≈øt enter into, whereby they expre≈ø≈øely and formally bind them≈øelves to the performing ≈øuch duties as they conceive to be required of them. This ≈øome make ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary, as if there could be no true and rightly con≈øtituted vi≈øible Church without it. They will not admit any to the Lords Table, though they cannot but judge them ≈øuch as have reall union and communion with Chri≈øt, neither will they admit their children to Bapti≈øm, except it appear that by ≈øuch a Covenant they are in Church-fellow≈øhip, or members of a Church, that is, gathered together by ≈øuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. But ≈øo far as I can ≈øee, the Scripture no where ≈øhews us, that ≈øuch a Covenant is requi≈øite. I grant, that in ≈øome ca≈øe, upon ≈øpeciall occa≈øion it may be meet for the members of a Church to Covenant together about tho≈øe things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, <hi>viz.</hi> for the reforming, or pre≈øerving of the Church from gro≈ø≈øe corruptions that have got, or are likely to get into it. Thus <hi>A≈øa</hi> and the people of Judah entred into a Covenant, as we read, 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 15. But ordinarily ≈øuch a Covenant is not nece≈ø≈øary. We read of many Churches plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apo≈øtles, yet of no ≈øuch Covenant: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find that the members of the Church were admitted into it by Bapti≈øm, by which all do ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Covenant one with another. <hi>Then they that gladly received the word, were baptized, and the ≈øame day there were added unto them about three thou≈øand ≈øouls. And they continued ≈øtedfa≈øt in the Apo≈øtles doctrine, and fellow≈øhip, and breaking of bread and prayers,</hi> Act. 2. 41, 42. <hi>For by one ≈øpirit are we all baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. <hi>There is
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:111827:197"/> one body, and one ≈øpirit, &amp;c. one Lord, one faith, one bapti≈øme,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4. 4, 5.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The ≈øound preaching of the word: this is<note place="margin">1. The ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond preaching<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of the word.</note> a principall note whereby the Church is to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. For 1.

            <p>A fal≈øe and corrupt Church is known by fal≈øe and corrupt doctrine. Therefore on the other ≈øide a true and ≈øound Church is known by true and ≈øound doctrine.

            <p>2. Another true note of the Church, is, The<note place="margin">2.

Christ ≈øent me not to baptize, but to preach the Go≈øpel,</hi> is not to be taken ≈øimply and ab≈øolutely, that the Apo≈øtle was not at all ≈øent to baptize; for, no doubt he had the ≈øame Commi≈ø≈øion as the other Apo≈øtles had: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, he there te≈øtifieth, that he did baptize ≈øome, though not many, v. 14. &amp; 16. whereas if Chri≈øt had not ≈øent him to baptize, he might not have baptized any.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:111827:208"/> not properly of the Church, and ≈øo not of the Saints now ≈øpoken of, which con≈øi≈øt onely of men and women.</p>
            <p>And the≈øe Saints are partly in heaven, where they are perfect and compleat Saints, ≈øo holy as to be <hi>without ≈øpot or wrinkle,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 5. 27. there are <hi>the ≈øpirits of ju≈øt men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12. 23.

Some are ≈øo ≈øimple as to think that there are no Saints but in heaven, when as the Scripture ≈øpeaks expre≈øly of <hi>the Saints that are upon the earth,</hi> P≈øal. 16. 3. And u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øually where Saints are mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Saints on earth are meant: As P≈øal. 34. 9. <hi>O fear the Lord all ye his Saints; for there is no lack to them that fear him.</hi> And P≈øal. 79. 2. <hi>The fle≈øh of thy Saints</hi> [have they given] <hi>to the bea≈øts of the earth.</hi> And Prov. 2. 8. <hi>He pre≈øerveth the way of his Saints.</hi> And 2 Cor. 13. 13. <hi>All the Saints ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you.</hi> And Phil. 4. 22. <hi>All the Saints ≈øalute you, chiefly they that are of</hi> Cae≈øars <hi>hou≈øhold.</hi> So in many other places: Now when we ≈øpeak of the Communion of Saints, both the Saints in heaven, and the Saints on earth are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood; both the one and the other have the communion here ≈øpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> with God, and with Chri≈øt, and with one another.</p>
            <p>Now the ground of communion is union;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:111827:208"/> fir≈øt therefore, the Saints have union with God, and with Chri≈øt, and with one another, and then they have communion with God, and with Chri≈øt, and with one another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With God: The Saints in heaven have perfect union with God, and ≈øo perfect commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. They have a clear ≈øight of God, they ≈øee him not (as here) <hi>through a gla≈ø≈øe, darkly, but face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. And they have a full fruition of God: <hi>In his pre≈øence they have fulne≈ø≈øe of joy, and at his right hand they have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures for evermore,</hi> P≈øal. 16. 11. So they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øantly ≈øounding forth <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> they are continually exerci≈øed in prai≈øing and magnifying God; <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they that dwell in thy hou≈øe, they will be ≈øtill prai≈øing thee.</hi> P≈øal. 84. 4. This is e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially true of tho≈øe that dwell in Gods upper hou≈øe, in heaven.</p>
            <p>The Saints on earth al≈øo have union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, though not in that perfect manner as they in heaven: The Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have union with God by ≈øight, the Saints on earth have only union with God by faith; <hi>For we walk by faith, and not by ≈øight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 7.

They are all knit together by one and the ≈øame ≈øpirit. <hi>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentils, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. The Apo≈øtle there ≈øpeaks of baptizing and drinking, becau≈øe the Sacraments, Bapti≈øme and the Lords Supper, are outward tokens and te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the union of the Saints, as they are here upon earth; but ≈øtill he mentions the ≈øpirit, as that whereby the union is indeed wrought. And as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ≈øo communion which flows from union. For as it is in the naturall body, ≈øo is it al≈øo in the my≈øticall, the members being united one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have communion one with another, becau≈øe as the members of the naturall body partake all
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:111827:210"/> of one ≈øoul, ≈øo the members of the my≈øtical body partake all of one ≈øpirit. Becau≈øe the Saints have <hi>the communion of the Holy Gho≈øt,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 14. <hi>the fellow≈øhip of the ≈øpirit,</hi> Phil. 2. 1. therefore they have communion and fellow≈øhip one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>Now the Saints being ≈øome in heaven, and ≈øome on earth, there ari≈øeth a fourfold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or fellow≈øhip which the Saints have one with another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a communion which the Saints in heaven have one with another. They certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce one in anothers happine≈ø≈øe, and prai≈øe God one for an other. Here men, and even ≈øometimes good men, through the corruption that is in them, envy one another, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> did <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> Num. 12. 1. But the Saints in heaven are wholly free from this di≈øtemper, they are made perfect in love and charity, which envieth not, 1 Cor. 13. 4. <hi>rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth,</hi> v. 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a communion, which the Saints in heaven have with the Saints on earth. They wi≈øh them that happine≈ø≈øe which them≈øelves have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, and in generall (as we may conceive) pray for them. For though they be not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the particular e≈øtate of the Saints here below, yet in generall they know that as they in heaven are triumphant, ≈øo their fellow-members on earth are militant, and therefore charity (as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith) never failing, they have a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 8.</note> of their ca≈øe (≈øo far forth as is con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtent with their own happine≈ø≈øe) and a care for them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:111827:210"/>3. There is a communion which the Saints on earth have with the Saints in heaven. They rejoyce in their happine≈ø≈øe, prai≈øe God for them, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their faith and conver≈øation, that ≈øo they al≈øo may partake of the ≈øame happine≈ø≈øe with them. Thus far forth the Scripture doth warrant our Communion with the Saints in heaven. <hi>For the memory of the ju≈øt is ble≈ø≈øed,</hi> Prov. 10. 7. <hi>All gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ≈øhall call me ble≈ø≈øed</hi> ≈øaid the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Luk. 1. 48. And the Apo≈øtle bids, <hi>Be followers of tho≈øe, who through faith and patience inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes,</hi> Heb. 6. 12. But for praying to the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, as they of the Church of Rome teach, we have no Scripture to countenance any ≈øuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but it is quite di≈ø≈øonant and repugnant to Scripture. God is he, to whom we mu≈øt pray, <hi>Call upon me,</hi> P≈øal. 50. 15. <hi>As for me I will call upon God,</hi> P≈øal. 55. 16. <hi>For this ≈øhall every one that is godly pray unto thee,</hi> P≈øal. 32. 6. <hi>After this manner therefore pray ye, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 6. 9. Neither mu≈øt we pray in the name of any but of Chri≈øt only. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, the man Christ Ie≈øus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. Be≈øides, the Saints departed do not under≈øtand our particular affairs. When a man is dead he is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the e≈øtate of ≈øuch as had mo≈øt near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto him. <hi>His ≈øons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it not of them,</hi> Job. 14. 21.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a Communion which the Saints on earth have one with another; &amp; this is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, which the Scripture chiefly ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of. <hi>They are kindly affectioned one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:111827:211"/> Rom. 12. 10. <hi>They rejoyce with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and weep with them that weep, v. 15. They have the ≈øame care one for another; If one member ≈øuffer, all the members ≈øuffer with it; if one member be honoured, they all rejoyce with it,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 25, 26. <hi>They bear one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> Gal. 6. 2. <hi>As every one hath received the gift, ≈øo they minister the ≈øame one to another, as good ≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the manifest grace of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 10.</p>
            <p>More particularly the Saints on earth have communion one with another. 1. in re≈øpect of ≈øpirituall things; they joyn together in the u≈øe of Gods Ordinances. Thus it is ≈øaid of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chri≈øtians, that <hi>they continued ≈øtedfastly in the Apo≈øtles doctrine, and fellow≈øhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers,</hi> Act. 2. 42. And v. 46. that <hi>they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, &amp;c.</hi> And the Apo≈øtle exhorts ≈øaying, <hi>And let us con≈øider one another, &amp;c. Not for≈øaking the a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our ≈øelves together, as the manner of ≈øome is,</hi> Heb. 10. 24, 25. According to their places and callings they teach and admoni≈øh one another, Col. 3. 16. They exhort one another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. &amp; 10. 25. They comfort and edifie one another, 1 The≈ø. 4. 18. &amp; 5. 11. They pray one for another, <hi>Ephe≈ø. 6. 18. Jam.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
            <p>2. In re≈øpect of temporall things; they ≈øuccour and relieve one another. It is recorded of the Saints in the Apo≈øtles time, that <hi>they had all things common, and ≈øold their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need,</hi> Act. 2. 44, 45. So Act. 4. 32. <hi>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one ≈øoul, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But this is over-gro≈ø≈øe. For 1. What was done by a few living together in one City, cannot conveniently be done by all throughout the vvorld. Neither then in the Apo≈øtles time was that communion injoyned, none was required to part with the intere≈øt that he had in any thing, as is clear by that of <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias, Whiles it remained, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This ≈øhewes that, <hi>Anamas</hi> might have cho≈øen whether he would fell his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion or no; and when he had ≈øold it, whether he would bring the money, that he had for it, to the Apo≈øtles or no.

If we ≈øay that we have fellow≈øhip with him, and walk in darkne≈ø≈øe, we lie, and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellow≈øhip one with another, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Be ye not une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually yoked together with unbelievers, for what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low≈øhip hath righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe with unrighteou≈øne≈ø≈øe? and what communion hath light with darkne≈ø≈øe? And what concord hath Christ with</hi> Belial? <hi>or what part hath he that believeth, with an Infidel? And what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Some under a pretence of ≈øanctity violate the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:111827:212"/> communion of Saints; they for≈øake the a≈ø≈øemblies of the Saints, becau≈øe of ≈øome in tho≈øe a≈ø≈øemblies by who≈øe ≈øociety they fear to be polluted: but this is either great hypocri≈øie, or a gro≈ø≈øe errour. <hi>Let a man examin him≈øelf,</hi> (≈øaid the Apo≈øtle) <hi>and ≈øo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 28. Therefore it is not the unworthine≈ø≈øe of others that can prejudice thee, if thou thy ≈øelf bee≈øt not unworthy. <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye ≈øeparate;</hi> how? <hi>and touch not the unclean thing,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 17.

Yet this is their comfort (and greater comfort then this they need not de≈øire) thorough Chri≈øt they are reconciled unto God, all their ≈øins are pardoned, and done away as if they had never been. See what expre≈ø≈øions are u≈øed in Scripture, whereby the forgivene≈ø≈øe of ≈øins is ≈øet forth vnto us.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2.

So he hath al≈øo a debt-book for ≈øins; but if we humbly and unfainedly turne unto him, he will blot our ≈øins out of his book, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver charge them upon us, never exact payment and ≈øatisfaction of us, ≈øeeing Chri≈øt hath made it for us, having with his blood <hi>blotted out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances that was again≈øt us, &amp;c.</hi> Col. 2. 14. The Prophet <hi>E≈øay</hi> u≈øeth this ≈øame meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore of blotting out, but he fetcheth it another way; <hi>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, and as a cloud, thy ≈øins,</hi> E≈øa. 44. 22. There ≈øinnes are compared to a cloud, a thick cloud which interpo≈øeth betwixt God and us, and keepeth off the bright beams of Gods favour and the light of his countenance from ≈øhining upon us: <hi>Your iniquities have ≈øeparated betwixt you and your God, and your ≈øins have hid his face from you,</hi> ≈øaith the ≈øame Prophet, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 59. 2. But
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:111827:218"/> ≈øins being remitted the cloud is blotted out, it is di≈øper≈øed and di≈øpelled, it vani≈øheth and is gone, that we may behold the face of God as of a loving Father, reconciled to us in Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>

But for ≈øuch as turne unto him, he ca≈øts their ≈øins behind his back; he will no more condemn them for their ≈øins, then if they were quite remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of his ≈øight, and he had no knowledge of them.</p>

            <p>This is a great my≈øtery, naturall rea≈øon cannot reach to the knowledge of it, will not yeeld a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent unto it.

Now if this be ≈øo, that the dead mu≈øt ri≈øe againe, then even in this re≈øpect there ought to be a re≈øpect had unto the dead, to bury them in a devout manner: Nature it ≈øelf doth teach this, that the bodies of the dead are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the earth; the Heathens generally did u≈øe it, excepting ≈øome who were more barbarous then others. As it is ≈øaid of the Hyrcanians, that they u≈øed to ca≈øt dead bodies to dogs to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured.</p>
            <p>The Romans in later times u≈øed to burne the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:111827:225"/> bodies of the dead, but more anciently (as <hi>Plinie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plin.

But to ≈øpeak of Gods people, they have ≈øhewed them≈øelves very carefull to perform this office of buriall unto the dead: The Story of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in this re≈øpect is recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. where we find how ≈øollicitous he was about the burying of <hi>Sarah</hi> when ≈øhe was dead: So it's ≈øaid <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 2. that <hi>devout men carried</hi> Stephen <hi>to be buried.</hi> It was a cu≈øtome among the Jewes to wa≈øh the dead body before they did bury it, as appears by that <hi>Acts 9. 37. Whom when they had wa≈øhed,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>they laid her in an upper chamber.</hi> The ≈øame cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtome al≈øo was among the Heathens. The Jewes u≈øed al≈øo to imbalme the dead, as appears by <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 7. and 19. 39, 40. The Heathens al≈øo have u≈øed the ≈øame, e≈øpecially the Egyptians, as both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Hi≈øtory ≈øheweth, and al≈øo ≈øacred, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. Now though the Heathens did u≈øe the≈øe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies vainly and ≈øuper≈øtitiou≈øly, yet no que≈øtion but the people of God had re≈øpect therein to the Re≈øurrection, ≈øhewing by the≈øe ceremonies which they u≈øed about the dead, that they believed that the dead ≈øhall ri≈øe again. Now there is no need of ≈øuch ceremonies for that end, the Article of the Re≈øurrection being by the Go≈øpell more fully manife≈øted then before: Yet this is of perpetuall ob≈øervation, that the bodies of the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:111827:225"/> dead be decently buried, as being in due time to be rai≈øed up againe.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe</hi> 2. Secondly, this point touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection doth teach us not to lament immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately for the dead: Lawfull it is to mourne in this ca≈øe; nature requires it, and grace doth not forbid it, as not extingui≈øhing naturall affections, but only rectifying them, and ≈øetting bounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Yea, the Apo≈øtle reckons it among the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt ≈øins, to be <hi>without naturall affection,</hi> Rom. 1. 31. The Saints have expre≈ø≈øed their affection in this kind: <hi>Abraham</hi> mourned for <hi>Sarah, Gen. 23. 2. Jo≈øeph</hi> fell upon his fathers face and wept when he was dead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 1. The godly made great lamentation for <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 8. 2. Yea Chri≈øt him≈øelf wept at the grave of <hi>Lazarus, Joh.</hi> 11. 35. Whereupon the Jewes that were pre≈øent ≈øaid, <hi>Behold how he loved him,</hi> v. 36. But this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ≈øorrow for the dead, mu≈øt be moderate, and that as in other re≈øpects, ≈øo in this, that the dead even in re≈øpect of the body, do not peri≈øh for ever, but at length ≈øhall ri≈øe againe. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the Apo≈øtle u≈øeth to this purpo≈øe; <hi>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them which are a≈øleep, that ye ≈øorrow not even as others that have no hope: For if we believe that Je≈øus died and ro≈øe againe, even ≈øo them al≈øo which ≈øleep in Ie≈øus will God bring with him,</hi> 1 The≈ø. 4. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V≈øe</hi> 3. The con≈øideration of this point, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Re≈øurrection of the dead, is of great force to comfort us in all afflictions, and to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate us again≈øt the fear of death it ≈øelf. This did
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:111827:226"/> ≈øupport <hi>Iob</hi> in his greate≈øt extremity, as appears<note place="margin">Job. 19. 25. 26. 27.</note> by the words before cited, and ≈øo it may well ≈øupport all that truly fear God, as <hi>Iob</hi> did: Death (which is the wor≈øt that can befall them) is but as the pulling down of an old ruinous hou≈øe, to build it againe in a more excellent and glorious manner: Or as if a ≈øtatue of bra≈ø≈øe, or any other mettall, being full of ru≈øt, and decayed with age, ≈øhould be ca≈øt into a furnace and melted, that ≈øo it may be made more pure and perfect then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Death in Scripture is often termed ≈øleep; as when a man ≈øleeps, he awakes again, and ri≈øes up more lively and vigorous then he was before, ≈øo ≈øhall the godly ari≈øe after death, and be in a condition incomparably better then this which here they are in. The Apo≈øtle ≈øhewes what a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is betwixt the body as now it is, and as it ≈øhall be in the Re≈øurrection; <hi>It is ≈øowne in corruption, it is rai≈øed in incorruption: It is ≈øowne in di≈øhonour, it is rai≈øed in glory: it is ≈øowne in weakne≈ø≈øe, it is rai≈øed in power: it is ≈øowne a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, it is rai≈øed a ≈øpirituall body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 42, 43, 44. The hope of this Re≈øurrection did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Saints and ≈øervants of God to indure the greate≈øt torments that their inraged adver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries could inflict upon them: <hi>They were tortured, not accepting of deliverance, that they might obtain a better Re≈øurrection,</hi> Heb. 11. 35.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe</hi> 4. Finally ≈øeeing there ≈øhall be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection of the dead, it behoves us to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour whiles we are here that we may attaine unto a ble≈ø≈øed Re≈øurrection hereafter, <hi>the Re≈øurrection of life,</hi> Joh. 5. 29. which is <hi>the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:111827:226"/> Re≈øurrection of the ju≈øt,</hi> Luke 14. 14. There ≈øhall indeed be a Re≈øurrection of all, <hi>both of ju≈øt, and the unju≈øt,</hi> Acts 24. 15. But as Chri≈øt ≈øaid of <hi>Iudas, It had been better for him that he had not been borne;</hi> ≈øo may I ≈øay of the wicked, It were better for them that they ≈øhould not ri≈øe againe, becau≈øe they ≈øhall ri≈øe unto condemnation, John 5. 29. But as for the righteous, they ≈øhall ≈øo ri≈øe, as <hi>to ≈øhine like the Sun in the Kingdome of their Father,</hi> Mat. 13. 43. Let us labour that we may be partakers of this Re≈øurrection: And to this end we mu≈øt here have our part in the fir≈øt re≈øurrection, that<note place="margin">Rev. 20. 6.</note> of the ≈øoul from the death of ≈øin to the life of grace, and then the ≈øecond death ≈øhall have no power over us.</p>
            <p>More particularly, fir≈øt, we mu≈øt be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Chri≈øt by faith; <hi>For he is the Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and the life, he that believeth in him, though he were dead, yet ≈øhall he live: And who≈øoever liveth, and believeth in him, ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver die,</hi> viz. eternally, Iohn 11. 25. Chri≈øt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ri≈øen from the dead, and entred into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ≈øo in due time ≈øhall all that belong unto Chri≈øt, that are members of his body; <hi>He will change their vile bodies, and make them like unto his owne mo≈øt glorious body,</hi> Philip. 3. 21.</p>
            <p>2. But if we would be thus conformed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chri≈øt in glory, and happine≈ø≈øe, we mu≈øt be conformed unto him in grace and holine≈ø≈øe; <hi>Every one that hath this hope, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:111827:227"/> even as he is pure,</hi> 1 Iohn 3. 3. <hi>Paul</hi> having ≈øaid, that he believed that there ≈øhall be a Re≈øurrection both of ju≈øt and unju≈øt, addes, <hi>And herein doe I exerci≈øe my ≈øelfe to have alwayes a con≈øcience void of offence both towards God and towards men,</hi> Acts 24. 16. <hi>As many as walke according to this rule, peace ≈øhall be upon them, and mercy,</hi> Gal. 6. 16.</p>

            <p>For the words of the Text, they were ≈øpoken by our Saviour, and that upon this occa≈øion: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> having ≈øeen how a certain rich man was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to forfeit his portion in the world to come, then to forgo his wealth that he had here in this world, ≈øaid unto Chri≈øt, <hi>Lo we have left all, and followed thee,</hi> v. 28.

            <p>The point to be ob≈øerved is this, That as there <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> is a temporall life for all here in this world, ≈øo there is an eternall life for ≈øome hereafter in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Both the Old and the New Te≈øtament beare witne≈ø≈øe to this truth, life everla≈øting is a≈ø≈øerted in both, yet more ≈øparingly and ob≈øcurely in the Old Te≈øtament, more frequently and clearly in the New Te≈øtament.</p>
            <p>As for the Old Te≈øtament, I do not find that everla≈øting life is expre≈øly mentioned in it, ≈øave only once, <hi>viz. Dan. 12. 2. Many of them that ≈øleep in the dust of the earth, ≈øhall awake, ≈øome to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verla≈øting life, &amp;c.</hi> Yet though not in ≈øuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe words, the Old Te≈øtament doth afford ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofs, that after this life there is another life to come, not as this, induring only for a time, but for ever: God did ≈øhew this unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, fir≈øt by types, figures, and re≈øemblances:</p>
            <p>As fir≈øt, the tree of life mentioned Gen. 2. &amp; 3. That was a type and figure of everla≈øting life, as appears by that Rev. 22. 14. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they that do his Commandements, that they may have right to the tree of life,</hi> &amp;c. And ≈øo Rev. 2. 7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the mid≈øt of the Paradi≈øe of God.</hi> In the≈øe places by the <hi>tree of life</hi> is meant eternall life, whereof that tree called the tree of life was a figure. What further u≈øe that tree was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, is over-curious, and not nece≈ø≈øary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: As for that <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22, 23. where it is ≈øaid,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:111827:228"/> that <hi>Adam</hi> having ≈øinned, God ca≈øt him out of Paradi≈øe, <hi>lea≈øt he ≈øhould put forth his hand, and take of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever;</hi> that (I ≈øay) the be≈øt Expo≈øiters take as ≈øpoken onely in re≈øpect of that opinion which <hi>Adam</hi> had, <hi>viz.</hi> that if he did eat of that tree, he ≈øhould never die; like as when God ≈øaid (as is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) <hi>Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evill;</hi> it was ≈øpoken ironically in re≈øpect of that which the Serpent ≈øaid unto the woman, that if they did eat of the forbidden fruit, they ≈øhould be as Gods, knowing good and evill, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. Some have thought that if man had eaten of the tree of life, he ≈øhould have thereby been free from death: But certainly the tree in it ≈øelfe could have no ≈øuch vertue in it, onely God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it as a Sacramentall ≈øigne of everla≈øting life, and man having by his tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion made him≈øelf unworthy of the thing, God would not ≈øuffer him to meddle with that whereby the thing was ≈øignified.</p>
            <p>2. The Sabbath ≈øpoken of in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and in other places of Scripture, did al≈øo prefigure eternall life, it was a figure of that everla≈øting Sabbath or re≈øt (for ≈øo the word Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath doth ≈øignifie as much as re≈øt) which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øhall keep in heaven. This is evident by the Apo≈øtles di≈øcour≈øe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. where having ≈øpoken of Gods re≈øt when the workes of Creation were fini≈øhed, in memory whereof God in≈øtituted the Sabbath, he ≈øaith, v. 9. <hi>There remaineth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a rest to the people of God;</hi> the word there ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>a re≈øt,</hi> imports (as is noted in the Margent) <hi>a</hi>

               <hi>keeping of a Sabbath.</hi> So that in the very word there u≈øed there is a manife≈øt allu≈øion to the Jewi≈øh Sabbath, as a type of that Sabbath or re≈øt there ≈øpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> eternall in the world to come. Which is further evident by that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, v, 11. <hi>Let us therefore labour to enter into that re≈øt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Land of Canaan, into which God brought the I≈øraelites, after that he brought them out of Egypt, as is recorded in the book of <hi>Io≈øhua,</hi> that likewi≈øe did typifie heaven, and that re≈øt which the I≈øraelites after a long and weari≈øome travell in the wilderne≈ø≈øe enjoyed in that Land, did typifie that re≈øt, which the Saints having pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed thorough the wilderne≈ø≈øe of this world, ≈øhall enjoy in heaven. This al≈øo is clear by comparing the words of <hi>David,</hi> P≈øal. 95. 11. with the Apo≈øtles di≈øcour≈øe upon them, <hi>Heb. 4. 7, 8. David</hi> ≈øaith that God being provoked by the I≈øraelites that came out of Egypt, <hi>≈øware in his wrath that they ≈øhould not enter into his re≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>David</hi> alledgeth this to deter others in after ages from provoking God in like manner, ≈øaying, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> P≈øal. 95. 7, 8. The Apo≈øtle hence proveth that by Gods re≈øt cannot be meant the Land of Canaan, or re≈øt in that Land; for that the people to whom <hi>David</hi> ≈øpake, were then in that Land, and did enjoy that re≈øt, and ≈øo the I≈øraelites had done long before: <hi>Again, he limiteth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day, ≈øaying in</hi> David, <hi>To day, after ≈øo long a time,</hi> (viz. that the I≈øraelites had re≈øted in Canaan) <hi>as it's ≈øaid, to day if ye will hear his voice harden
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:111827:229"/> not your hearts. For if Ie≈øus</hi> (that is <hi>Io≈øua</hi> as the margent noteth, who brought the I≈øraelites into Canaan) <hi>had given them re≈øt, then would he not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward have ≈øpoken of another day.</hi> That is, if that re≈øt in Canaan which <hi>Jo≈øua</hi> as their Captaine and Leader brought them into, had been all the re≈øt which God intended for his people, then he would not ≈øo long after by <hi>David</hi> have ≈øaid, <hi>To day,</hi> &amp;c. threatning them that except they were obedient unto him, they ≈øhould be debarred from entring into his re≈øt. This argues that God by his Re≈øt meant another re≈øt, <hi>viz.</hi> an everla≈øting re≈øt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whereof that re≈øt in Canaan was but a figure. Thus the Apo≈øtle there immediately infers, <hi>There remaineth therefore a re≈øt unto the people of God,</hi> v. 9. and addes v. 11. <hi>Let us labour therefore to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that rest, lea≈øt any man fall after the ≈øame exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of unbelief.</hi> And hence it was that the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes did make ≈øuch account of the Land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. <hi>Jacob</hi> cau≈øed <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> to ≈øwear that he would not bury him in Egypt, where he died, but carry him into Canaan, and bury him there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 29. 30, 31. And the ≈øame charge he gave to all his ≈øons immediately before his death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 29. &amp;c. And they did what he enjoyned them, as is related <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. where al≈øo v. 25. is ≈øhewed how <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> likewi≈øe made his brethren to ≈øwear that they would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his bones with them into Canaan when they went. And <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 19. it is ≈øaid that Mo≈øes <hi>took the bones of</hi> Jo≈øeph <hi>with him,</hi> when he and the I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites went out of Egypt. <hi>Stephen</hi> al≈øo ≈øhewes that ≈øo the re≈øt of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ≈øons, though they died in Egypt, were carried into Canaan to be laid
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:111827:230"/> there, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 15, 16. The≈øe Patriarks had not any ≈øuper≈øtitious opinion of that Land, as the Jews of late times have, and ≈øo the Papi≈øts have of Churches and Church-yards, but they both ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them≈øelves to die in faith, not doubting but that God at length would perform the promi≈øe that he had made concerning the Land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and al≈øo they looked at that Land as a type of heaven, where eternall re≈øt is prepared for all Gods elect people.</p>
            <p>2. In the time of the old Te≈øtament God ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto his people that there is a life everla≈øting in the world to come, by examples of ≈øome, whom he took and tran≈ølated out of this world into the other without death intervening: Thus it is ≈øaid Gen. 5. 24. that <hi>Enoch wnlked with God, and he was not, for God took him;</hi> That is, <hi>he was tran≈ølated that he ≈øhould not ≈øee death,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. So <hi>Eliah</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up alive into heaven, as we read 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. The≈øe examples ≈øhew that be≈øides this life here in this world, there ≈øhall be another hereafter in the world to come.</p>
            <p>3. After that <hi>Abraham I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were dead, God ≈øtiled him≈øelf <hi>the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> I≈øaac, <hi>&amp; the God of</hi> Jacob, Exod. 3. 6. Now as Chri≈øt ≈øaid unto the Sadduces, <hi>God is not God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> Mat. 22. 32.

There are 3. branches of this Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us acquaint our ≈øelves well with the Scripture. <hi>Search in the book of God, and read,</hi> I≈øai. 31. 16. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> John 5. 39. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:111827:239"/> 1. That God hath ordained the Scriptures for this end, that we might be in≈øtructed and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them. <hi>They were written for our learning,</hi> Rom. 15. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is a ≈øingular mercy that we have the Scriptures. <hi>David</hi> magnifies the goodne≈ø≈øe of God towards the I≈øraelites in this re≈øpect; <hi>He hath given his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ≈øtatutes and his Ordinances unto</hi> I≈ørael. <hi>He hath not dealt ≈øo with any Nation, &amp;c.</hi> P≈øal. 147. 19, 20. So <hi>Paul</hi> notes this as the great priviledge which the Jews had above others, that <hi>unto them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 1, 2. The greater the mercy is, the more grievous is the contempt of it. <hi>I have written unto them</hi> (≈øaith God) <hi>the great things of my Law, and they were counted as a ≈øtrange thing,</hi> Ho≈ø. 8. 12.</p>

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:111827:240"/> old in matters of Religion: In our Saviours time there were ≈øeverall opinions concerning him, <hi>Some ≈øaid he is a good man; others ≈øaid, nay, but he deceiveth the people,</hi> Joh. 7. 12. See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo Joh. 7. 40.‚Äî43. and Mat. 19. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture hath fore≈øhewed, that there ≈øhall be fal≈øe doctrines and here≈øies; <hi>There ≈øhall ari≈øe fal≈øe Chri≈øts, and fal≈øe Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 24. 24. <hi>But there were fal≈øe Prophets al≈øo among the people, even as there ≈øhall be fal≈øe Teachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, who privily ≈øhall bring in damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 2. 1.</p>
            <p>3<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Such is the malice of Satan, that he will doe what he can to pervert the truth: where God ≈øowes good corne, he will ≈øow tares, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 39.</p>
            <p>4. God ≈øuffers it to be ≈øo, fir≈øt, to try tho≈øe that are his; <hi>There mu≈øt be here≈øies among you, that they which are approved may be made manife≈øt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 19. See Deut. 13. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>2. That the truth may be more cleared and confirmed then otherwi≈øe it would be, if it were not impugned and oppo≈øed: See Acts 15. 1. 2. 6. 7, 22. &amp;c. 30. 31. It is ob≈øerved, that the Doctors that were before <hi>Pelagius,</hi> wrote more ≈øecurely concerning grace and free will, but when <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> aro≈øe, and a≈ø≈øerted free will, ≈øo as that he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew grace, then <hi>Austine</hi> and others be≈øtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them≈øelves, and made it evident, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods grace man hath no power nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in him to do any thing whereby to plea≈øe God.</p>
            <p>But again, ≈øome ≈øtumble at this, that ≈øuch as
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:111827:240"/> were eminent for profe≈ø≈øion, fall into gro≈ø≈øe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; but neither is there any cau≈øe to ≈øtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at this: For thus al≈øo it hath been even in the Apo≈øtles time, <hi>Nicolas</hi> was of no mean repute in the Church, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 5. Yet (it ≈øeems) he became the Author of a dete≈øtable Sect called the Nicolaitans, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 15. So what account <hi>Paul</hi> made of <hi>Demas,</hi> we ≈øee <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 14. and <hi>Philem.</hi> ver≈øe 24. yet he proved an Apo≈øtate, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
            <p>2. This al≈øo is fore-told: <hi>The Spirit ≈øpeaketh expre≈øly, that in the later times ≈øome ≈øhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ≈øeducing ≈øpirits,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 4. 1. The falling away of Profe≈ø≈øors ≈øhould make us take heed to our ≈øelves, and cleave the more clo≈øe to the truth, as <hi>Peter</hi> admoni≈øheth, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 17. Take heed le≈øt ye al≈øo be carried away with the error of the wicked, and fall from your ≈øtedfastne≈ø≈øe.</hi> So I come to the third branch of the Exhortation.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore let us hold fa≈øt the truth delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scripture; <hi>Buy the truth and ≈øell it not,</hi> Prov. 23. 23. <hi>Hold fa≈øt that which is good,</hi> 1 The≈ø. 5. 21. <hi>Hold fa≈øt the form of ≈øound words,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 1. 13, 14. <hi>Let us hold fa≈øt the profe≈ø≈øion of our faith without wavering,</hi> Heb. 10. 23.</p>
            <p>To this end, fir≈øt be well grounded in the truth; fal≈øe Teachers <hi>ea≈øily lead captive ≈øilly women, that are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 6, 7. <hi>That we henceforth be no more children, to≈ø≈øed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 4. 14.</p>
            <pb n="466" facs="tcp:111827:241"/>
            <p>2. Be ≈øincere in the profe≈ø≈øion of the truth: <hi>Becau≈øe they received not the love of the truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For this cau≈øe God ≈øhall ≈øend them ≈øtrong delu≈øion, that they ≈øhould believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure in unrighteou≈øne≈ø≈øe,</hi> 2 The≈ø. 2. 10, 11, 12.<note place="margin">Superbia e≈øt mater omnium haere≈øe√¥n.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Be humble: <hi>Pride</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Au≈øtine) is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all here≈øies.</hi> And <hi>Calvin</hi> found it verified in <hi>Servetus</hi> a wretched heretike; he notes of him, that he was exceeding proud, and being de≈øirous to get him≈øelfe a name, thought this the faire≈øt way<note place="margin">Lu≈øitanico fastu inflatus, magis etiamnum propri√¢ arroganti√¢ turgens, hanc ≈øibi comparandi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis rationem optimam e≈ø≈øe ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit, ≈øi omnia religionis principia convelleret. <hi>Calvin. adver≈ø. Servet.</hi>
               </note> whereby to attaine unto it, to ≈øhake the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion: So the Scripture te≈øtifies of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who bewitched the people of Samaria, (and as Eccle≈øia≈øticall Writers record of him, was the Author of divers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies) that <hi>he gave out that him≈øelf was ≈øome great one,</hi> Acts 8. 9. Doubtle≈ø≈øe, this is a main cau≈øe why many in the≈øe times fall into gro≈ø≈øe and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrous errors, they are puffed up with a conceit of them≈øelves, and they would be eminent above others; and therefore rather then they will be content with plain truth, they will imbrace pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable error. Be≈øides, the proud tru≈øting in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, God leaves them to them≈øelves, and ≈øo what is ≈øo ab≈øurd, but through the ≈øugge≈øtion of Satan, and the corruption of their owne heart, they are ready to imbrace it? <hi>A ≈øcorner ≈øeeketh wi≈ødome, but he findeth it not,</hi> Prov. 14. 6. For <hi>God ≈øcorneth the ≈øcorners, but giveth gracee unto the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:111827:241"/> lowly,</hi> Prov. 3. 34. <hi>God re≈øi≈øteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> Jam. 4. 6. and 1 Pet. 5. 5.</p>
            <p>4. Beware of covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe and worldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedne≈ø≈øe; earthly advantages are of great force to with-draw from the truth. This was it that drew away <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. <hi>Demas hath for≈øaken me, having loved this pre≈øent world: Peter</hi> ≈øpeaking of fal≈øe Teachers, ≈øhewes that this doth ≈øet them on work, <hi>And through covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe ≈øhall they make merchandi≈øe of you,</hi> 2 Pet. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>5. Beware of all ≈øin what≈øoever. For it dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the under≈øtanding, perverts the will, di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the affections, alienates from God, and gives advantage unto Satan. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ≈øaith of a ≈øtrange woman, may be applied to a ≈øtrange Doctrine; <hi>Who ≈øo plea≈øeth God, ≈øhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcape from her, but the ≈øinner ≈øhall be taken by her,</hi> Eccle≈ø. 7. 26. The Apo≈øtle therefore bidding <hi>hold faith,</hi> addes, <hi>and a good con≈øcience, which ≈øome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put away, concerning faith have made ≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 29. And ≈øo he notes, that they are not only <hi>≈øilly women,</hi> but ≈øuch al≈øo as are <hi>laden with ≈øins,</hi> that are u≈øually led captive by fal≈øe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>6. Labour to increa≈øe grace more and more; <hi>Take heed le≈øt ye al≈øo being carried away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ≈øtedfa≈øtne≈ø≈øe; but</hi> (as a means to avoid that mi≈øchief) <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>7. Pray continually unto God to guide and keep you in the truth, except God lead us into
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:111827:242"/> it, we ≈øhall never find it, and except he keeps us in it, we ≈øhal ≈øoon lo≈øe it: <hi>The God of al grace, &amp;c. make you perfect, ≈øtabli≈øh, ≈øtrengthen ≈øettle you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 10. <hi>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, &amp;c.</hi> Jude v. 24. and ≈øo much for this point.</p>
            <p>Again the words of the Text hold out unto us this, That Chri≈øtians ought earne≈øtly to contend <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> for the truth; to do what in them lies to pre≈øerve &amp; maintain it, again≈øt tho≈øe that do oppo≈øe it. All Chri≈øtians ought <hi>to be fellow-helpers to the truth,</hi> 3 Jo. 8. Such are commended as do this: <hi>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evill, and thou ha≈øt tried them which ≈øay they are Apo≈øtles, and are not, and ha≈øt found them liars,</hi> Revel. 2. 2.</p>
            <p>Such are reproved as neglect this. <hi>But I have a few things again≈øt thee, becau≈øe thou ha≈øt them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, &amp;c. So hast thou al≈øo them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate, Repent &amp;c.</hi> Revel. 2. 14, 15, 16. Good rea≈øon there is why Chri≈øtians ≈øhould do this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Out of zeal for Gods glory. As wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, ≈øo al≈øo wicked opinions di≈øhonour God.
